Dear Students,

Welcome to Spring 2026 and WS 297V: Feminist Disability Justice, offered through the [Women's and Gender Studies Department at Pace University](https://www.pace.edu/dyson/departments/womens-and-gender-studies){:target="_blank"}, chaired by [Dr. Meghana Nayak](mnayak@pace.edu) (your point-person if you have an administrative problem that goes beyond our course).

In the first week of classes, you'll need to set yourself up for a successful semester by doing everything listed in [Week 1](https://visforvali.github.io/ws297v/) in the Calendar on the home page, including:

- Reviewing the [Syllabus](/ws297v/syllabus), [Alt-Grading System](/ws297v/alt-grading), and other materials on this website.
- Joining our Discord server (invitation link posted to Classes\Content\Syllabus) and [customizing your server profile](https://visforvali.github.io/ws297v/discord/#customizing-your-profile), selecting your roles, and introducing yourself. (For a quick guide to setting up Discord for this class, review the full [Discord Tutorial](/ws297v/discord).)
- Read Sins Invalid's "10 Principles of Disability Justice" and Leah Piepzna-Samarasinha, "Crip Emotional Intelligence."

We don't have a physical classroom. Our online classroom is our Discord server, WS297V Classroom, where we'll talk and write and work together. Like physical buildings you aren't familiar with, Discord might initially seem confusing, but it's pretty intuitive with a little exploration, is more low-key than Classes, and won't track you, steal your work, or accuse you of plagiarism like many AI-integrated learning management systems, including Classes.

This course works best when we all treat it like a space to chill and learn, not a space where you anxiously await judgment or avoid it by staying silent. We all have things to contribute, and we'll all get lost and trip up along the way. Nurturing your curiosity despite those mistakes, learning to productively, vocally engage with discomfort, is what writing and advocacy work is all about.

Can't wait to virtually meet you very soon!

🚀 To infinity and beyond,
