# How do I schedule a coffee chat with you?

After clicking [🍵 Let's Chat!](https://zcal.co/drmani){:target="_blank"} at the top right, follow the directions on Zcal to reserve an appointment. First, select the time interval you want (🕛10, 🕐15, or 🕑20 min) at the bottom left, then choose a date/time that works for you.

If there are no available timeslots on a given day, it means I'm fully booked and you'll have to reserve another date/time. I tend to be fully booked around the middle and end of the semester, so make sure to book early and often!

# How are access needs addressed in the course?

With the caveat that universal access is impossible &mdash; it's inevitable that people's access needs aren't always compatible &mdash; but still worth striving for, here's what I'll be doing to address your self-selected access needs in this course (without sacrificing my own):

- I use color-coding, typeface, and/or emoji to offset important information on the website or Discord, like reminders, info that deserves extra emphasis in the modules, tl;dr summaries, and practice exercises
- To addresss the need for advance notice, the Calendar lists all work you'll do for yourself and work you'll submit to me for the whole semester. All assignments are already described on the website, and you have access to the spaces where you need to post them on Discord (for low-stakes work) and Classes (for high-stakes work)
 - *Note*: All modules will be live this week; after that, you'll have advance notice for everything we do this semester and can pace yourself accordingly
- I have already identified and separated weekly tasks on the Calendar, but I'll do my best to breakdown these tasks further where relevant in a checklist of work at the beginning of each weekly module
 - *Note*: Always cross-check the work you have to do with the work listed on the calendar!
- All audiovisual content provided has alt-text and captions
- When I can estimate time, I'll include that at the top of each weekly module. It's hard to estimate task time for research-related reading and writing assignments, because we all work at different paces, and this is an async course. That said, you should be able to complete the "regular" work for each week within 3-5 hrs &mdash; similar to an onsite 3-credit core writing course (3 hrs of "classtime" and 2 hrs of work done outside of class). As in onsite core writing classes, drafting and revision may take longer
- I only do weekly check-ins via Discord, due to my own needs and to easily link you to specific posts/channels from weekly discussion. You'll receive feedback on your learning in #classroom during our discussions each week, in #team channels during workshop, and on Classes after submitting essay drafts.
 - If you prefer email for communication, I'll email you if I have any other reason to contact you (like a participation issue, or if your low-stakes posts can't be accepted for credit). If you prefer Discord, I'll communicate with you through DMs or voice notes if I have a reason to contact you.
 - I am much faster on Discord. If you prefer email, please note I reply to emails within 48 hrs and never on weekends. Regardless, email can't replace our Discord classroom, so get into the habit of checking the app daily. Installing the phone app might make this (plus working on-the-go!) easier.
- In a full class setting, I'm unable to send frequent, tailored reminders for work already outlined in the materials. I can automate weekly reminders to check the Calendar for work due that week through Discord. Any other reminders will be posted to both #classroom and Classes\Announcements (so make sure you've set up Classes to forward announcements to your email if email is your communication preference). 
- Content notes will be provided if/when relevant.
- Disciplinary language is unavoidable in a class like this, but in weekly modules, I use both plain language and attempt to introduce and explain necessary conceptual terms in plain language.
