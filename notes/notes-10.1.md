# 10.1 - Indigenous Identity

Welcome back, comrades! Today, we'll start with our next solo journaling game, *Auspex*, to make sure we get to it; followed by a discussion of Okri's parables and Roanhorse's SFF short story.

*Choose one of the following spreads to guide your answer to this question!*

**Tarot Spread 1: Rat King**

## Welcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience™

Circling back to Okri: 

- Regarding "Knowledge," what is the relationship we’re invited to see between knowledge and water, specifically the woman’s demonstration? What is the difference between the dean of faculties and the invited speaker, and what details tell you this? What is the meaning of the academics perceiving a flood and the woman showing that when she stops her demonstration everything is dry? 
- Regarding "Love," what is meant by the river goddess/real river leaving without a forwarding address so to speak because "if something is there, your people take it for granted"? What are we meant to infer from the idea that water only stays because it's loved? What does the river mean when she says "Our fates are linked. When I'm gone, you will never return"? What are we meant to understand by the river's prophecy being fulfilled, that when she disappears the town will die, and after it comes to pass, that he seeks it wherever he goes? 
- What does the parable form make the reader responsible for? Why might this be an even more important craft technique given contemporary changes in literacy and attention?

"Welcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience™" is Rebecca Roanhorse's debut story, published in 2017 and awarded the Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Science Fiction/Speculative Fiction short story. It's a second-person narrative that's both straightforward and very layered, about Indigenous identity, authenticity, and stereotypes about Native experience, using virtual reality and a second-person address like an interactive video game where the reader assumes the role of the protagonist to convey much of this.

A surface-level summary might be: you a.k.a. Jesse Turnblatt work a virtual reality gig where you set up digital Experiences for clients, or Tourists, seeking something "authentically" Indian. (As a side note, I'll use "Indian" often here in keeping with the term the story uses.) These Experiences are straight out of cowboy movie depictions of the Old West, even though Jesse is authentically Indian &mdash; he borrows from film, uses the a-little-too-on-the-nose name "Trueblood," specializes in the Vision Quest experience, keeps weaving back and forth in the use of "authentic," and other words like "lost" and "good Indian." He meets a Tourist he names White Wolf who surprises him, as he seems to be seeking an actual genuine Indian experience; they become friends outside of work and Jesse tells him all about himself, then during a bout of illness White Wolf infiltrates and takes over his life, starting with his job, then his wife, his house. 

Knowing that on at least one level this is a story about cultural appropriation, by the ending, whose Experience do you think it was, based on that last line and what other textual clues back up that theory?

Jesse bases his Experience son Hollywood Native-ness, the faux "feel good" authenticity that Tourists want &mdash; spirit animals and vision quests and sexist, colonialist, sexual fantasies &mdash; and at first it seems like it's this constant faux authenticity that leads to Jesse/you wanting to believe that a stranger who wants to get to know the real him isn't a pretendian but a genuine ally, possibly even genuinely Native. Only when it's too late does Jesse start to realize otherwise, and by then the cycle of appropriation has gone so far it's reached role-reversal proportions: White Wolf, in the end having become more authentic than Jesse off of Jesse's life experience, is now presumed to be "from the rez," looking more and more like a stereotype of a good Indian, with long hair, muscled abs, a bone choker, high cheekbones. But White Wolf's only claim to Native-ness that we see is a distant Cherokee relative. not that he's from the rez, or that he's registered with his tribe. DNA isn't the same as culture. 

Also, since this is a sci-fi story, I want to note that the allegedly liberating technologies aren't liberating for all people &mdash; technological advances, capitalism, pop culture, government treatises, all conspire here to confine Native Americans to simulated stereotypical identities. Cultural genocide, forced assimilation, materialistic capitalism, whitewashing Native Americans into more palatable "Indians." Ultimately Roanhorse's story is a series of colonial tropes filtered through various simulacra that lead to Jesse's loss of all identity &mdash; to, in another possible reading, disconnection from reality itself. 

As the Alexie quote suggests &mdash; the narrative trap of "Indians" makes ghosts of Native Americans.

Jesse, or whoever you are, you let go at the end like you describe happens when an Experience terminates &mdash; but it seems like we're in the real world, not virtual reality. The suggestion is that forced assimilation upon assimilation has altered reality itself. Building up to the disconnection is a series of observations about discrepancies, uncertainties, sudden doubts about reality creeping in. 

Tell me what clues you notice in how these sentences are crafted:

- "This guy is good, a real rez guy. Last  name's 'Wolf.' I mean, shit, you can't get more Indian than that."
- About White Wolf: "Maybe it's the ribbon shirt he's wearing, or the bone choker around his neck. Is his skin a little tanner than it was last week?"
- "It all feels like a terrible dream, like the worst kind. The ones you can't wake up from because it’s real life."
- "It's true, but it’s not true, too."
- "'Did you ever think,' White Wolf says, his voice thoughtful, his head tilted to study you like a strange foreign body, "that maybe this is my experience, and you're the tourist here?'"
'"This is my house," you protest, but you're not sure you believe it now."

And working backwards from that, here are other words, lines, and moments that might indicate that the roles might have been flipped all along: that we've been complicit in cultural appropriation since we entered Jesse's vantage point from the very beginning.

Tell me what clues you notice in how these sentences are crafted:

- "We're not the right kind of Indian."
- "Or maybe you watch too much TV. You really aren’t sure anymore."
- "No more real than the caricature of an Indian you have conjured up."
- "Things you are good at faking. Things you get paid to pretend."
- "Maybe he just wants something that's authentic."
- "This time sounding much more Indian, you are sure."
- "A sensation like part of your soul is being stretched too thin."
- "Part of why the Experience works is that everyone knows their role. But White Wolf don’t seem to care about the rules."
- "White Wolf never seems to tire of your stories and it's been so long since you had a new friend to tell them to, that you can't seem to quit."

We're asynchronous on Thursday and there's no class on Veteran's Day, so between now and next Thursday, I'd like you to complete the Auspex game and do a little #team workshop of a couple of the Beast/Hunter and Auspex journal entries you like best and might use for the final project (instructions forthcoming!). Directions will be posted to the Week 10.2 lecture notes by tomorrow evening.
