# 7.2 - Écriture Féminine

Welcome back, comrades! We're in the middle of a discussion about how theoretical fiction as a genre blends theoretical and fictional elements, often preserving an investment in poetics and evocation alongside intellectualizing and a frequently activist bent. All good stories are theoretical, and we tell stories and write theories to make sense of our lives. 

Margaret Atwood's fiction is often located at the interstices of genres, especially in her early theoretical fiction work like *Murder in the Dark*. The theoretical work of "Bread" and other pieces in this collection reflect on the text's emphasis on sense receptivity and the ways the senses contribute to knowledge making in relation to the text's language, reality, and interpretive framework. To extend our previous discussion, theoretical fiction is women's writing, a specifically feminist project of moving away from rational masculine writing toward something more embodied, more willing to recognize the text and use it as artifice &mdash; not a one to one representation of reality. The theoretical fiction movement was essentially a theoretical project &mdash; dismantling language as one of patriarchy's institutions as used up to this moment in the late 1970s and early 1980s; the explosion of the exact verisimilitude demanded by patriarchal language; the construction of a "feminine" language linked to the body; and an increased emphasis on the participation of the reader in the co-creation of the text through the very act of reading &mdash; of interacting with the text however it invites or enables them to. "Bread" is a game: involving artifice, a changing reality, an "eye" that isn't the organ with which we see the phenomenal world but the mind's eye, a reality made with language &mdash; whose changing nature makes clear that neither vision nor language are dependable. Other senses must be used to get at any sort of truth, and that truth is not a narrative resolution but a shift in the reader's own relationship to reality, to many realities, most of which may lie beyond their experience. After all, what is it to be not hungry but starving? Smell and taste, often downplayed in the sensory hierarchy, are privileged. In this sense, the craft of theoretical fiction like this piece serves to deconstruct the text by deconstructing the body in order to construct new feminine/nonconforming/non-patriarchal bodies, languages, and realities via new textual forms and fictions.

"Sleep is hard to talk about. It's what you don't know you're doing while you do it," as Ursula Le Guin once wrote. *The Book of Sleep* was written during the Arab Spring in Egypt, when widespread protests were unraveling the Egyptian government. It uses experimental fiction, philosophy, phenomenology, advocacy writing, journalism, and poetry to unpack the 2011 coup d'etat in Egypt and chronicle and reflect on the conditions that led to the uprisings. Instead of resorting to fact-checked narratives to bear witness, though, El Wardany communicates his memoir by considering sleep &mdash; an often overlooked, incomprehensible, misunderstood, denigrated, yet pivotal part of existence. Under tyrannical fascism, sleep is an expression of personal freedom and liberation, a surplus activity at odds with productivity and order, a space where dreamers might and do dangerously envision rebellion &mdash; and wake rejuvenated enough to try. 

Sleep is here described like a transient state of waking from what is unchangeable, allegedly, locating truth not in the world we see when capitalism calls us awake but in the liminal space created internally and externally when we close our our eyes and nod off. Against the backdrop of the Arab Spring, possibility and hope are reimagined through poetry and metaphor, through the importance of sleeping and dreaming, through riddle-like ideas that are as intentionally confusing as everything that happens on the threshold between sleep and waking.

## Line Analysis

"Sleep requires this work, then, because only work makes the effort to reach out and touch sleep's faint trace without trying to make it present or to convert it into an object of inquiry... And just as sleep hands itself to work, so work gives itself to sleep, each proceeding towards the other like head meeting pillow. Because work needs sleep" (1)

"Only when the writer surrenders himself to sleep and the force which grips work is broken does work become possible once again" (2)

"Sleep and work need one another. The first wants something which it can approach without waking it, the second wants something which can forget it, and make it possible once more" (2)

"Sleep on public transit and in public squares, in lecture halls or at work, is a twofold rejection of the social act because it takes place, not in our private bedrooms, but at the very heart of traditional sites of social interaction" (11)

"At the very heart of the social disruption which sleep effects, can be discerned a renewed faith in the other. One without any identifiable cause" (11)

"Sleep in public, then, is a declaration of faith in the other, and the other in question, the other next to whom the sleeper sleeps with such assurance, is not one person but a whole community of the unknown" (11)

"Sleeping while occupying is the true heart of the occupation, the essence which all are seeking, and any occupation where the occupiers do not bed down in their place of protest cannot be relied on" (13)

"This is sleep. It is in this apathy, and nowhere else, that the power to merge public and private resides &mdash; to make the public private and the private public &mdash; and so achieve the purpose of the occupation" (14)

"They (the hours) never acquire any mass worth mentioning, nor presence. They are forever hovering in the background: ineffectual, ignored, a neglected excess that everyone knows about and no one speaks of" (19)

"What if sleep and wakefulness were not a pair of states which pass in succession through us, one springing from the other, but two intertwined bodily experiences?" (46)

"The difference between the waking and the sleeper is that the former tends to preserve his social body and reaffirm its boundaries, while the latter moves to blur the body, to muddy its purity by opening it to others" (62)

"Each sleeper is an inarticulate social body, a city broken free of its map, its districts and streets run together, fit not for habitation but perpetual displacement" (62)

"What the state of sleep proposes is that there is no individual as distinct from a group, and no group made up of individuals. There are only groups" (63)

"The dividing line between sleep and waking is the inner border of the state. There, power is disrupted and laws dissolve" (94)

"(Sleep) is the site of narrative interruption and belongs not to the worlds of truth or fiction but to another category altogether: to that of poetry. Poetry is alternative fact, reality in fantasy; realistic narratives become conjectural and hypotheticals are made real... Poetry, like history, is the constant mixing of these two categories: the real and the hypothetical" (113)

"Unconsciousness is sleep's corruption, occurring when sleep has failed to free itself both from the binaries of its surroundings and from its assigned function: a brief dousing of consciousness. Industrial capitalism reduced sleep to a function, its task to grant the faltering consciousness a measure of relief" (143)

"And as the attention economy replaces the production economy, consciousness becomes neurotic, turning endlessly about itself and fired by a promise forever unhonoured. How can such a consciousness sleep? It is constantly afraid that it might miss something, that the promise will be honoured in its absence. All it can do is remain alert until it drops into unconsciousness. Capitalism's night grows shorter and shorter until it almost vanishes altogether, and in it sleep is one long coma dispensed in doses" (143)
