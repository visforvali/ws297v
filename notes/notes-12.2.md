# 12.1 - Navigating a Haunted House

## *Dwelling* Worldbuilding

They've been happening more, unavoidable with the stress of moving. The stress of grieving &mdash; change and then more change. I've taken to waking up at night, pacing the rooms or reading until I'm tired enough to sleep once more. I don't always remember my dreams but sometimes the vividness of them is alarming: changing shifting rooms, a house I barely recognize but I know it's mine, and the dream shifts as if I'm suddenly in a horror movie, trying to escape a haunted house. 

I wake up and the dreams blurs into the corners and nooks of my room, with the ghosts following me out into wakefulness, until my eyes adjust and it's simply dark. These dreams make sleep even harder to find. An old house has quirks and I just need to figure them out. Learn its needs and anticipate them as if they were my own. Still as of late all I have is sleepless nights. Waking up out of a dead sleep, dazed and disoriented, my eyes scanning the shapes in the dark for any sense of familiarity. Frozen in bed, I watch shadows twist and turn into fantastical shapes and though I'm uncertain if it's a trick of my eyes or from the light filtering in from outside but it seems as if they...move? Surely a fabrication of an overactive imagination, along with the creaks and groans that sometimes wake me in the dead of night...

## Instructions for Dwelling

*Dwelling* is a horror story and a game, it's a story of a haunted house and the ghosts that reside in it but it is also a self-guided experience into memory recollection, creative writing, and drawing. 

*Dwelling* is also a sketchbook and a journal, providing you space amongst its scenes and words for you to record your interactions with the house and its inhabitants. In this game, you will read a story, write a story, and illustrate the ghosts that haunt your home in response to the prompts provided in the narrative and from connections made to your own memories and experiences.

*Dwelling* is a story written for you. You're the "I" in this story: home alone, sleepless and wandering. Dwelling is also a story that wants to be yours, but its narrative has its own pace and motivations. Dwelling doesn't wait for you, rather, it gives you space to collaborate, to modify the story and to make it yours as it unfolds. Within the narration are the prompts for interaction, and the inspiration for your responses are woven into what you will experience in the house. Your words in response to the musings in the narration are your own and are as much a part of the train of thought as the words that precede them.
You'll be presented with room descriptions and, when the text prompts us, read you journaling prompts that will change the story in some way for you. 

## *Dwelling*: Bedroom	

It's not even the noises in the night that I have a hard time with. It's the shadows. There is often enough ambient light in the house that I can get around just fine at night, but sometimes the shadows that creep along the walls and in corners send my mind wandering in the wee hours of the night. I know I'm still adjusting to this house and all these things, even the noises and the light, are unfamiliar experiences to get adjusted to. I can't help feeling the crawling unease at times. With the house being such a drastic change from the last place I called home, and also being somewhat unpredictable, I've had a hard time adjusting. The electricity has issues. Power outages aren't uncommon around here, it seems. The layout of the house is strange. Some nights I find myself walking towards the kitchen and end up in the living room, or find myself revisiting rooms I just left trying to make my way to the stairs. Something I've chalked up to stress-induced mindless wandering, but still, it's all a little disorientating. And again, the dreams. They seem so mundane yet something's peculiar about them. So vivid in the moment but days later I couldn’t tell you what had happened in them. Dreams about wandering the house late at night..."
I awake.

My eyes haze and adjust as they try to make sense of the unfamiliar shapes in the dark. For a moment I don't remember where I am and panic. As thoughts roll into the back of my mind I remember that I'm in my house. My new house that was left to me in a will by my Uncle. He passed away half a year ago and he lived alone and had no kids to pass his things on to. So the house went to me. The paperwork I've signed recently stacks in my mind as if building up the pages to how I got here, my body, autonomic in its dream state, wants to mime out the words and signatures once more. Running my hands over a letter, written to me and included with all the paperwork, a last message telling me what this house meant to him, and what it could mean to me now that it'll be my home.

There's a sinking feeling in my gut, in this place that's now mine, a gain through loss. Still, months have passed and paperwork was signed and I'm in an old house that is new to me. I haven't gotten used to its sounds, its shapes, the feel of it just yet. So, I wake up some nights, to sounds or to a weird feeling, something unfamiliar enough that it stirs me out of my dreams. As I settle into wakefulness my body begins to orient itself in this new space.
I shift, letting the sensation of my skin against sheets register my body in place in my bed. Legs tangled, arms heavy, the pulsating pangs of consciousness secedes into a tired wakefulness. As my body wakes up, I look around and try to place myself within the space. My room, doors, and windows are all in their wrong places, so I seek out my things and where they are in my room to know where I am. 

I let my eyes languidly take in the walls around me and make sense of the still-unfamiliar shadows, tracing the shapes with my unfocused eyes still hazy from sleep. In my sleep-addled imagination, my mind conjures a shape in the shadows, the way the darkness piles at the end of my bed, making the dark shapes against the wall look as if something is peering over the edge of my bed, looking up at me. 

[*15 min writing interlude: What is the ghost of memory haunting this room? Why this room? Why are they still here? Why are you compelled to record it in writing?*]

I shake my head and rub my eyes and the creeping shadows are now unrecognizable as anything, just the folds of sheets into the shadows on the floor below.
The arrangement of walls and windows and doors is different than I'm used to, but I managed to make the room work in a way I really liked. My bed, across from a south-facing window, lets the morning light in. Dresser pressed against the wall and my small but functional desk sits under the Windowsill. The bare surfaces in my bedroom are starting to accumulate clutter. My favourite knickknacks draw my eye to the top of the dresser, or to the top of my desk, a jumble of things and books. The walls too are less bare, the south wall I opted to paint my favourite colour, and around the window are polaroids of memories from last fall.

On the nightstand next to me is the book I've been reading, looking over at the cover I try to remember where the story was going when I left off. I fumbled the book back onto the nightstand before trying to sleep and I still have the mark of a small paper cut on my fingertip.
