# 16.1 - Departures

As we close out the semester this week, you'll share your drafts of your final projects to your #team channels and engage in a guided workshop. Your workshop will be guided by the Feedback Survey below, which is a set of questions you should answer for each of your teammates' papers. 

Here are the general instructions:

1. Out of respect for your team members, please post your drafts to your #team channel by Tuesday 8AM so your peers have time to read and review before the Thursday night deadline. (If you post a Google Doc link, make sure you've enabled sharing permissions.)

2. Read like a reader, not an editor or professor. Effective feedback starts with responding based on your thought process and internal cognitive and emotional reactions to the text. 

3. Effective feedback is also: actionable and specific (spelled out in a way that the writer can actually carry out in a timely fashion); non-prescriptive (offers suggestions, not demands); and generous (doesn't assume the writer intended to make mistakes, whether it's misreading assignment directions, not emulating a specific craft technique, etc.) while kindly telling the writer what they needed to do differently.

4. Don't talk about your projects! First, read without commenting. You can read and make marginalia, underline/highlight what you think the claim is, make notes about what you think the writer's aims are, etc.

5. Answer all the questions in the Feedback Survey below for each of your teammates' drafts, and post your answers as a reply to your teammate in your #team channel. **This process must be complete by Thurs 8AM at the latest**.

5. After receiving feedback, read what your teammates wrote, and discuss any questions you have together as a group. You may want to ask questions about what their comments mean, how they suggest enacting those comments, collaboratively write your way towards enacting those comments, and so on.

# Feedback Survey

Answer the below questions for each of your teammates' drafts. Post your responses to your #team channel as a reply to each teammate (or tag them in your post with @username). 

1. Is there a clearly identifiable social justice issue around which the entire compilation coheres?
2. Is the writer using at least 1 distinct craft technique from one of the readings we discussed this semester in *each* of their pieces?
3. Did the writer include at least 1 piece from each of the solo journaling games we played (*Belluae/Venatores, Auspex, Dwelling*)?
4. Is the chosen form/technique well-suited for the subject? Why/why not? If not, what form/technique would be better suited to the subject, and why?
5. Does the writer spend an equal amount of space or time to each craft technique? If not, is it clear why the technique(s) they spend more time on are more important than the other ones?
6. Did the writer include a preface that identifies their goals in composing and compiling their manuscript and explains their craft decisions (i.e. whose techniques they chose to emulate and why) and design (i.e. arrangement in and across pieces)?
7. When you compare the draft with the project guidelines, what major criteria are absent or need improvement? Tell the writer how they might take care of that.
8. What 2-3 items from the feedback survey questions above feel like top priority items for the writer's paper?

I highly recommend you plan to drop in for a sync coffee chat during our scheduled class time if you have any questions or want to review your project together in real time! 

Happy drafting and reviewing!
