Once you've finished everything, follow the instructions below for a mini #team workshop!

# *Belluae/Venatores* Stage 4

## B&V Stage 4: Beast 

The changes are happening rapidly and then not at all. Like the moon, your body waxes and wanes, it is full, and it is new. You're almost unrecognizable, save for the things people can't help but know as you. Your eyes, a smile, hands, scars and marks. You have more and less of... (pick three):

- Eyes
- Teeth
- Mouths
- Hands 
- Limbs
- Hair
- Skin
- Feathers
- Fur
- Chitin
- Mineral
- Scales
- Wings
- Claws
- Tails
- Metal
- Stone
- Wood
- Gills
- Beaks
- Snouts
- Fins
- Wings
- Spores
- Dust
- Gas
- Ooze
- Clay
- Horns
- Hooves
- Leaves
- Flowers
- Blood
- Tears
- Cinder
- Mud
- Frost

Write to your love about your dark urges, about how as your new body blossoms so do new desires. Answer the following 3 prompts in your letter:

- What new hungers do you have?
- What about your new urges that you hate to indulge in?
- Which of your own fears about your change do you derive sick delight from?

## B&V Stage 4: Hunter 

After a moment locked in time with the monster, after ruminating on what it's capable of, you prepare to set up a trap. You fashion the area with dangers (pick three):

- A pit
- A net
- Spikes
- Trenches
- A falling rock
- A deep pool
- A barrier
- A box
- A labyrinth
- A snare

After the trap is set up, you lie in wait. While you do, the following 3 things happen:

- The monster escapes.
- The monster bides its time.
- The trap is destroyed.

In the process of watching the trap go off, you have time to think. Pick two reflections that come up while watching it all unfold:

- You want to see this creature struggle, for it to be hopeless and vulnerable. How will you hurt it once it is weakened?
- A sick curiosity overtakes you. What shape does this abomination take? You want to see the creature in its full foul glory; what horrid things do you think you will see?
- One time you caught your love in a lie, you set a trap for them, too. Eventually the truth came out, what did you do to humiliate them? To shame them?
- Even if it is trapped and helpless, you are unsure if it can be killed. What methods do you think you can use to assure its end?
- Once this creature is trapped, you want to be able to look deep into its eyes. What will you do to make the look of fear pass over whatever it manifests as a face?
- A thought of the trapped creature, with its thrashing and horrible sounds, a noise that could draw your love to you. If they found you, how would they embrace you?
- There is no doubt in your mind that this creature has hurt your love, if not physically, then emotionally, psychologically. How will you enact your revenge on the monster for the hurt it has caused?
- Once the monster is trapped, the advantage will be yours. With nowhere for it to escape to, you will finally end its life. Do you want the chase to be over?
- Once you can gaze upon the monster's cold dead eyes. Then you will know a new kind of peace. What will come with this stillness?
- Sometimes, love makes you feel trapped. Your responsibilities to another can ensnare you. What were all the ways you lashed out like a wounded animal?

# *Belluae/Venatores* Stage 5

## B&V Stage 5: Beast 

Each day you stare into your reflection in water, in polished steel, in broken glass, and each day you see less and less of yourself. You’ve finally lost the last remnant of yourself. What is the last human part you lose? (pick one):

- Eyes
- Hair
- Smile
- Scars
- Laugh
- Voice
- Teeth
- Fingernails
- Skin
- Blood
- Hunger
- Sleep
- Breath

Write to your love about what few memories of humanity you cling onto. Answer the following 2 prompts in your letter:

- When was a time you felt great pleasure? Why does it
compare nothing to what you feel now?
- What part of you feels so ready to let all these memories go?

## B&V Stage 5: Hunter 

Your trap goes off, it succeeds, or it fails in such a way that the monster breaks free, but not unscathed. You can see it more clearly now, an abomination of human and creature, and it's hurt. You strike out at it, landing a single blow and it retaliates in kind. You exchange wounds. Pick one for you, and one for the monster:

- Bitten
- Bludgeoned
- Shot
- Lashed
- Stabbed
- Scratched
- Lanced
- Poisoned
- Suffocated
- Slashed

You and the monster withdraw, but stay close, watching one another. The monster proceeds like this:

- Strike. A violent lash.

And you proceed like this:

- Defend. A reactionary resist.
- Weave. A skilled evasion.

In this moment, locked in each other's sights, only the briefest thoughts cross your mind. Pick two reflections:

- Is this it? Is it going to kill me?
- A glimmer of recognition registers in the monster's eyes, what is it?
- You ache, you are in pain, how will you make it hurt worse?
- It shows a level of violence you must match, how will you escalate its violence?
- In this moment you feel like a predator, what will your teeth sink into?
- Its strange body moves unnaturally, what about it awes you?
- In its eyes you see yourself, what is unrecognizable to you?
- It's hurt, how can you exploit that to take it down?
- Your body surges with adrenaline, dare you attack it with your bare hands?
- Your stances, anger, bloodlust matched, what are you becoming?

# *Belluae/Venatores* Stage 6

## B&V Stage 6: Beast 

The change is almost complete. Your body is no longer human. You have lost any features that were once yours. The only thing that remains is your mind, and even that is slipping. You find yourself falling into urges and drives. Into thought that is image and form and not idea or word. You are the faltering human consciousness sinking deep into a beast. It is warm, it is dangerous, it is comforting in that darkness. Which of your qualities does your beastly self revel in? Pick five:

- Feral
- Dominating
- Hunting
- Ensnaring
- Deceiving
- Conniving
- Stalking
- Hungering
- Seeking
- Claiming
- Yearning
- Luxuriating
- Lounging
- Propagating
- Rutting
- Drifting
- Rooting
- Scuttling
- Swimming
- Flying
- Gathering
- Creating
- Destroying
- Scaring
- Confusing

Write to your lover about what you are becoming, about how it's different, about how it's better, about how it's worse. Answer the following six prompts in your letter:

- What does your new diet subsist of?
- What part of yourself do you wish you had no conscious thoughts about?
- What can you perceive that you never could before?
- What remnants of your human life are around you that you no longer understand?
- How difficult is it to write this letter? How hard is it to hold onto the human language?
- How does it feel to no longer recognize yourself?

## B&V Stage 6: Hunter 

The monster retreats, and you know you only have a small window to follow, to kill it while it's hurt. To end this. You patch yourself up the best you can with what you brought with you and you ready yourself. You write one last entry, knowing this is very well your last. You write about how you prepare, what you’re ready for, and what you’re not. You prepare. 

Include the following 4 corresponding prompts in your reflection.

- A makeshift weapon. You cobble together a new instrument of violence.
- Your wits. You have to be alert, ready.
- For nothing to ever be the same. Coming out of this alive will change you.
- For a long, violent night. This fight may not go quick, you could be warring until dawn.

# *Belluae/Venatores* Stage 7

## B&V Stage 7: Beast 

Your transformation is complete. There is nothing human left in you. You are now roaming seething beast. How does your human life end? There is only one way for it to end. It ends:

- Quietly, you wake up anew.
- Violently, you thrash until the last of your humanity dies.
- Deliciously, you slink out of your human consciousness, luxuriating in being something new.
- Curiously, you blink, and you are something else, something seeking comfort and sensation.
- Regretfully, you leave all your human potential behind, starting a whole new life.
- Dreadfully, your last human feeling is fear, until you become something that barely understands the feeling.
- Along with your monster life, you take your own life before the transformation completes.

If you tried to a write a letter, the most you could manage was four words. Write one anyway.

## B&V Stage 7: Hunter

You follow the monster back to where it's been hiding. Its den is littered with blood, and viscera, and familiar torn remnants of clothes. The ground scattered in letters of a messy but barely recognizable scrawl. Your love is nowhere in sight, but with this much blood, you can be sure: the worst has happened. This ends now. You will now kill the beast. How does it end? There is only one way. It ends:

- Violently, with the monster finally slain at your feet. 
- Quietly, you sneak up on them and catch them by surprise.
- With scars, you kill the monster, but they lash out, maiming you.
- With both your bloody deaths, you and the monster battle until you both bleed out.
- With a truce, you end each other's lives, gently, with a soft lingering death.
- With your violent end, the monster bests you, even if you go out fighting.
- With your quiet end, you never saw the beast coming, death came like a gasp.

After all this, if you added anything to your journal, it would only be a single sentence. Write it as a hasty addendum.

# Mini-Workshop in #team Channels!

Choose one entry from your set of "Beast" stories and one entry from your set of "Hunter" stories and share them in your #team channel. Reflect on the following questions together:

- What craft techniques do you notice in each other's pieces?
- Do these pieces seem suggestive, in content or craft, of any particular social justice issue? If so, what? What in the pieces suggests that to you?
