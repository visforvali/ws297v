# 7.1 - Theory-Fiction

Welcome back, comrades! By now you should have finished the Beast/Hunter journaling game; we'll work with these pieces later, and if you revisit the assignment guidelines, you'll see that at least some of your writing from journaling games must be adapted for the end-of-semester project. 

Today, we'll get caught up with Sen's lyric essay of annotated bibliography entries and go on to discuss Boully’s lyric essay of footnotes. On Thursday, we'll discuss Atwood and El Wardany. Time permitting, we'll begin our next writing game this week too.

Theoretical fiction is one name, the most common name, for the blending of fiction and theory, which loosely describes a variety of forms and themes. They overlap in their use of the intellectual to design a fictional story and the use of the fictional to lend poetry to the intellectual. By this I don't mean to suggest that stories &mdash; our typical shorthand for fiction &mdash; aren't intellectual but that all stories are inherently intellectual &mdash; all theory potentially poetic. Creative writing especially for social justice so often is the art of translating the theoretical, intellectual, educational, institutional, political, and discipline-specific into the poetic, imaginative, speculative, affective, and evocative. 

Theoretical fiction as a genre is usually traced to French Canadian writers, and a school of Australian scholar-writers, who called it fictocriticism.  The name fictocriticism might make additionally apparent that the fiction genre itself becomes critical &mdash; at least for those who presume it wasn't already critical &mdash; and its critical elements become more emphasized or brought to the surface. Of the pieces we’re discussing this week, Atwood and El Wardany's work most explicitly does this; while Boully's work does something theoretical through its form, Atwood's uses fiction and poetics to stage theoretical questions about gender, class, race, poverty, famine, and war; and El Wardany philosophizes about sleep, activism, resistance, and occupation under capitalism, written lyrically and poetically, at times even with the lulling quality that good sleep is known for.

While we didn’t initially read Sen's piece in the context of theoretical fiction, it can also be read that way &mdash; the annotated bibliography, after all, is a theoretical form associated solely with research &mdash; and even more so with school. Like Boully's piece, it uses form to enact something theoretical while altering what we expect to be theoretical and replacing it with content that's speculative, fictional, and poetic as much as it's theoretical.

**Q.** What is gained by blending theory and fiction? Or is this a false dichotomy?
**Q.** What's gained by working through any frustration or confusion that arises when reading something genre-fluid whose philosophical denseness and poetic intricacies might one or both be difficult to understand?

Nibedita Sen's "Ten Excerpts from an Annotated Bibliography on the Cannibal Women of Ratnabar Island" practically defies mass reproduction. It's an idea conveyed from multiple angles with very few words, where each annotated bibliography entry is like a word-picture of a book in the bibliography (like Ratnabar, none of these sources are real but are treated like they are) and of the world in question &mdash; Ratnabar Island and its colonization by the British, the former being a place that we don't and can't know due to its fictional status and the latter being all too knowable due to the legacies of British imperialism and colonialism. 

We learn through these annotated bibliography entries &mdash; that we later realize are written by a school=aged descendant of the surviving girls &mdash; how Ratnabar, populated almost entirely by women and children, is decimated by British colonists, probably because of the Ratnabari practice of cannibalism &mdash; after which some of the surviving girls are brought to England. At a British school, a British girl feeds her flesh to her classmates, including Regina Gaur, for reasons we're left to infer (though we're told by Regina's daughter that Regina didn't plan it or know that Emma was). 

The different texts offer us glimpses of changing social attitudes, historical values and norms, of exoticizing, Othering views. 1965 gives us the slaughter as a tragic misunderstanding of a practice that is politely unnamed. 1943 shows us the headmistress' account of the abduction of the girls as noble and civilizing, meant to rehabilitate them from their own culture. 1904 mentions shapeshifting. A feminist writer in 2004 says that women are forced by men to limit their appetites, focusing on gender and grieving the cultural clash. An academic ethnographer peppers her work with academic jargon. A history of lesbianism considers the relationship between Regina and Emma. The final four entries all belong to Regina's descendants. As a whole, the piece shows us a colonial power’s developing perception of a foreign culture and its people &mdash; a strange place to be explored, then something monstrous to be destroyed, then something exotic to appropriate, then the perspectives of the ethnic group themselves speaking from the margins after years of non-belonging, after their culture has been torn apart, misinterpreted, misused. 

**Q.** Which voices uphold dominant culture? Which fight oppression? Which are self-serving resisters? The narrative, like a fragmented lost culture, becomes a puzzle that can never be fully solved.

Jenny Boully's *The Body: An Essay* is a contemplation of absence, an essay of footnotes to a text that doesn’t exist &mdash; or at least that we can't see. We are given a very shielded narrative that's simultaneously a scholarly treatise, a love letter, reflections on faith, a dream log, thoughts about dreaming. This is a text that's entirely inference, ultimately saying more about the reader and about how we project our imagination, experience, and desires onto the text &mdash; whether it's there or not. Each line does a lot of heavy lifting. For instance: "<sup>3</sup> This was corrected in the second edition by the author." 

**Q.** How did you find yourself interacting with the text?

**Q.** What did you immediately notice about the form of this piece? How would you describe the effect of its craft? What is the relationship between its craft and its content?

The footnotes seem to serve different functions. Some invite active reader participation, like the fill-in-the-blanks form of footnote 5 invites active reader participation. Footnote 7 poses a riddle that can be easily answered based on common sense knowledge of astronomy and cleaning products &mdash; Comet! &mdash; and also invites sensory memories associated with bleach, which may be ordinary (like routine cleaning) or out of the ordinary (like a hospitalization). The inclusion of a date with no clues "8 July 8, 1976," leaves the reader to look it up and/or completely fill in the blanks.

**Q.** What are these references building to, for you?

**Q.** What's the effect of beginning with this footnote? "<sup>1</sup> Because the weather and landscape was forever shifting and birds gave birth to new birds that birthed new birds ad infinitum, this passage is, historically, inaccurate. The main argument, however, remains unaffected."

And then there are footnotes, like the last ones in this excerpt, that footnote or reference each other: "<sup>15</sup> You will never find the life for which you are searching" (G.) b," "<sup>b</sup> This particular footnote is imagined as being elucidated by a future editor," "<sup>16</sup> Except, perhaps, for poets and prostitutes."

**Q.** What does this signal to us, whether or not we know the information is important?
