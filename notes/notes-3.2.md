# 3.2 - Subverting Expectations

Welcome back, comrades. I want to pause briefly and ask: Does anyone have any new thoughts about what we’ve read so far, now that you’ve had time to reflect further after our discussion?

# *The Stanley Parable*

To build on previous explanations for why we game in this class, and why games have something to teach us about creative writing for social justice, let me offer a little more context for that, and a brief explanation of why I'm about to show you the video game I'm about to show you. What we expect of narratives becomes very apparent in games, where form is inherently part of play: our actions and reasoning become part of the narrative and propel it along.

If the form doesn't reinforce the narrative, or at least align with it, the player will end up frustrated or confused; and if the form subverts player expectations about what the form of the game should be, then in order to create a seamless experience of play those subversions and disruptions should be part of the game narrative, somehow. A "broken" form can, for instance, be used to enact a "broken" (insofar as it isn't mainstream/normative) life experience, or a "broken" system. 

I'm going to show you one possible ending in a game called *The Stanley Parable*, which essentially serves as an anti-work treatise. The voiceover narrator instructs the player on where to go and what to do, which will result in Stanley discovering that his all-consuming office job has been brainwashing him to keep him docile, and he escapes the facility. However, players often misbehave, testing the limits of the form/world in which they find themselves, like purposely dying. In this game, going against the narrator's instructions is possible but leads to narrative confusion; the narrator vocally laments what you're doing to his story in a way that recalls the creative writing process. In this genre, the structure reinforces the absurdity of work and of a story where the protagonist can ultimately be freed from work. You can break the structure for a while but the narrator will always hard-reset you. The game operates on a loop for as long as you choose to play it, also like the repetitive nature of work. Like Fredric Jameson wrote in *Seeds of Time* (1994), "It is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism."

What are the usual expectations of a game's form and mechanics? That is, what do we take for granted about how we enter and participate in games?

(Here's a video of the route we played: [*The Stanley Parable* Confusion Ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsi9ubfqzKs){:target="_blank"})

What does something like this tell us about the relationship between form and content? What is the effect of a destabilized environment or subverted narrative expectations in a game positioning itself against "corporate drone" work?

There's a lesson embedded here, for both game design and story design, about how creators should prioritize, think about, and carefully select the form they're working in.

# *Belluae/Venatores*

## *Belluae/Venatores* Beast: Stage 2

You can feel your body shifting, something is moving and changing under your skin. In your isolation you have had much time to reflect. 

You are (pick one):

- becoming larger
- becoming smaller
- losing something
- growing something
- fading
- glowing

Write to your love about how you first suspected the change, and how you hid it. Draw four cards from the Pentacles pile and answer the corresponding prompts in your letter (these are the 4 I drew for the class):

- You started wandering somewhere while in a haze, where to?
- What did you start seeing that no one else could?
- What did you start hearing that no one else could?
- Who first noticed something off about you?

And I drew 2 extra cards as "bonus" prompts if you want them!

- What strange new thing did you crave?
- What new fear started to overwhelm you?

## *Belluae/Venatores* Hunter: Stage 2

You found their trail, bare footsteps that lead away from your home and out, into dirt, into areas where human life fades away and nature creeps in. You follow them through the night until the dawn brings with it the first sign of the monster. 

Investigate the scene by responding to 3 prompts in your journal (I drew these 3 for the class):

- You notice a small body limp on the ground, an animal has been killed, what has the monster done to it?
- The rough ground gives way to smooth impressions in the ground. The shape of strange tracks and markings pressed into the dirt. Describe or sketch what you see. What could leave these markings?
- Deep tracks, dead plants, destroyed structures and trees, even rock split in two. Your mind reels with what this creature is, the size of it, the form it takes, how does it kill?

And I drew 2 extra cards as "bonus" prompts if you want them!

- Clumps of human hair are scattered all about, some of it the colour of your love's hair but other strands that shift and change in colour. Is this actually from a human, from your love, or something else entirely?
- You find strange scratches in the dirt and rock, like an attempt to write, is it from the monster or your love? What are they trying to communicate?

While investigating, you can't help but ruminate. Pick two reflections and respond to them in your journal.

- You can't help but fixate on what your love might be thinking, feeling, as they try and fail to flee from this monster.
- You take a moment to think about how you'll kill something so unknown to you. How can you prepare for such a thing?
- Seeing the lack of evidence that your love was here, you wonder if this is a good or bad sign. Do you wish for more of a sign of them just to know they were here?
- You imagine what it will be like to see your love again, about how happy they will be to see you, about how grateful they will be.
- How did they use to show gratitude?
- A single gut wrenching fear bolsters you on in your pursuit. What is it?
- Looking at the destruction around you, you think about a fight the two of you had, the time you destroyed something they loved.
- Did you ever feel guilty for your actions?
- You think of the last time the two of you were out in nature. What about the elements made the trip difficult?
- There is a chance your love followed the monster out in the wild, whatever could have compelled them to do that? What hold did the monster have over them?
- You think about the last time you saw your love smile, laugh, you think about what you two were doing and how you so desperately long to see their smile again. Was this monster the only reason they hadn’t smiled as much recently?
- You think about the last thing your said to your love. What about those last words make your stomach drop?
