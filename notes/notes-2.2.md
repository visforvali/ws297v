# 2.2 - Form as Resistance

Welcome, comrades. Before we get into it today, please reply to my DM if I asked you what your IRL identity is for enrollment verification purposes. I also want to remind you that your high-stakes project will revolve around a specific social justice issue. Review the assignment guidelines, and for now, think about the specific social justice issue about which you think you’d want to write a "collection" of short pieces this semester. You can modify writing you do for low-stakes question posts and in our role-playing sessions, and add new work as needed or wanted.

Additionally, I want to explicitly note that it's not informative to ask "why" questions about plot or an author's motivations &mdash; neither is confirmable to us &mdash; but we can and should ask why and how the effect of writing decisions and overall craft works to cultivate in readers a particular disposition that bears them back into the rest of their lives &mdash; particularly in the context of social justice.

Now, let's return to our discussion of Kim with a discussion of rhythm. We talk about rhythm in this class because the more you notice it, copy it, practice it, the more you'll internalize it and be able to easily reproduce it. For instance, the first sentence is 25 words long and uses this syllabic structure: 10, 5, 10, 3. Notice that the second phrase uses half the syllables of the first and third, creating a sense of diminishment followed by expansion, culminating in onomatopoeic words: 3, an expected rhythmic pattern.

Now, post in #classroom a briefly named social injustice (as specific as financial barriers to attending university, or as abstract as gatekeeping education). Next, post a briefly named institution (as specific as Pace University, or as abstract as higher education). We're going to play with two sentences at the bottom of page 3: "Without the kid in the hole, Omelas was just paradise. With the load-bearing, suffering child, Omelas meant something." Rewrite this as "Without X, Y is just Z. With X, Y means something" &mdash; where X comes from the list of social injustices we just generated in the chat, Y comes from this list of institutions, and Z is an adjective of your choice. 

It isn't easy work. But writing well in any genre means getting so accustomed to doing this work, it becomes second nature. This is especially true of creative writing for social justice, where subtly conveying a sensation or disposition can make or break an attempt to alter a reader’s worldview. 

**Line Analysis**

Tell me something about the form of these lines:

This aside: "Everyone (me, you, the newscasters, the janitors with the good PPE, the children who lived  inside and outside Omelas) was performatively disgusted by the video. Everyone watched it  anyway."

This use of "kid" and "kid-killers": "What the Omelans didn't say was that their second grievance was due to the fact that the kid killers had broken the unspoken code: if you had a problem with the load-bearing suffering child, you were supposed to get the hell out of Omelas and keep it to yourself. You weren't supposed to kill the kid."

This use of dialogue: "'I'm sorry about that,' the murderer said, and he sounded genuine. He sounded like he really cared about the well-being of all the Omelans and their susceptibility to freak accidents, but he cared about the one kid just a little more."

This use of walking away from Omelas: "The day after the lethal injection, the fifth kid was killed in the hole. And then the executioner walked out of Omelas, but no one paid attention to her leaving."

We'll read a lot of texts in this class that are lyric essays or borrow from the rules (insofar as there are any) of lyric essays: and there's a reason for that, and the reason is that the lyric essay is a genre of resistance. 

If you had to describe how your reading and writing cognitive processes operate, how would you? What does it mean to not see yourself in a form, as a reader or writer? 

What is the lyric essay, and what does it mean to write from the margins in a form that is, explicitly, a marginal and marginalized genre? "More a quality of writing than a category," the lyric essay is maybe enjoying renewed visibility and attention but isn't a new form, and it isn't an exclusively Euro-Western form with an exclusively Euro-Western origin. Boussiere & Trabold's introduction is in the form of a lyric essay, using fragments and white space, with the co-editors alternating voices with stories of their experiences of writing and writing lyric essays specifically. 

The lyric essay was at least categorized as such in 1997 by John D’Agata and Deborah Tall, because they noticed an uptick in literary magazine submissions that defied easy classification. Sometimes your experience or the story you're trying to tell doesn't fit a linear, continuous format &mdash; sometimes it's broken, disparate, incongruous, incomprehensible, marked by long pauses or the silence born of oppression or inability to conceptualize let alone speak. 

The lyric essay, with its freedom from most formal constraints, is a welcoming vehicle for these stories &mdash; stories of systematic and institutional abuses, microaggressions, genocide, protest and resistance, trauma, experiences of racism, ableism, misogyny, and homophobia but also BIPOC, feminist, queer, disabled joy. Because not all stories should be forced to follow one-size-fits-all rules regarding linearity, temporality, transitions, and should be allowed to inject frustration and disruption purposely created to offer or reinforce a socially just message.

# *Belluae/Venatores*: Worldbuilding

**Content warnings for the game**: body horror, violence, sexuality, interpersonal conflict, and an allusion to suicide.

The first of our solo journaling roleplays starts today. This game is slightly modified from Seb Pines' *Belluae/Venatores*. The key difference is, since we're using it as a writing exercise, you won't be playing for suspense or narrative payoff. You'll be playing it to feel what it's like to alternate points-of-view, and to make them nuanced, even and especially when those points-of-view are distasteful. Effective creative writing for social justice is writing that treats every character as the protagonist of their own story, and has their own motivations that are real (not cartoonishly evil or heroic or self-aggrandizing). 

This game plays out through letters, written over 7 days. Every time we play, you'll write a letter as, first, the beast, then as the hunter. Each day has prompts that help you build out what you will write about in your letters. During the beast's path, you'll go through seven stages of change, manifesting as a creature unlike any other while writing your last human words to your love (platonic, romantic, familial; it's up to you). During the hunter's path, you'll track the beast that stole your love from you.

{: .important }
> The hunter does not know the beast *is* their loved one. The beast does not know their loved one is pursuing them.

{: .warning }
> **Beasts**: Your writing can meander, tangent, and be absolutely incoherent, depending on the stage of infection. You're losing your humanity; your mind may as well go with it.

{: .warning }
> **Hunters**: Write about your feelings, to your love, about your love, about yourself, to yourself. This journal may be the only remains anyone ever finds of you and if you were to fail, you want your love to know you did it all for them, that your last thought was of them.

Where relevant, I'll select our journaling prompts by drawing cards from a tarot deck during class and reading the corresponding prompts. At the end of our game campaign, you can decide which "collection" of writing you like best; I'll ask you to select that role (Beast or Hunter) on Day 7.

## Ground rules

You must channel the mindset you're given, but you can play within that mindset as much as you want and as much as the prompts allow. 

# *Belluae/Venatores*: Beast - Introduction

You felt the changes at the start. The way you moved, the sharpness of your thoughts, the change in the taste of the air. You could smell the fear and confusion in everyone around you and their fear felt bitter and smooth upon your tongue. It coated and crept into your molars like a cavity. You savored it. By the time you started changing, it was too late. You had already been something monstrous for far too long. The world around you is unrecognizable, and this new body feels more like home than anywhere else. You cannot stop the change, and deep down, you don't want to. You want to grow and shift into something monstrous. You must leave the one you love, the last tether you have to yourself, the old you. Breaking their heart from a distance is better than ripping it out with your bare hands. 

As you flee, as you change, you'll leave letters for your love, in the hopes they might find and read them. In your letters, you'll write to them about your love, your fears, your desires, why they can never see you again, why they can’t come looking for you, and why you are so much happier now as a hideous shifting thing than you ever were with them.

# *Belluae/Venatores*: Beast - Stage 1

The changes have started manifesting physically; you have to leave quickly. 

Pick a pair of qualities you are adopting (and note them in your journal, as they will influence how you think about your transformation):

- tooth & claw
- scale & slither
- formless & free
- fin & filigree
- ink & wood 
- shadow & smiles
- mask & wire
- root & thorn
- slink & slime
- unknowable & uncontainable
- hoof & horn
- gold & gash
- feather & flight
- cloth & color
- herald & heresy
- flame & ash
- frost & stone
- web & weave

Now, write your first letter: Address it to your love and, in under 20 words, tell them you are leaving and why they can't follow. 

(You might also want to note your thought process for yourself, e.g. did you tell your love what you're changing into? Did you conceal the real reason out of fear or shame? Did you try to say as much or as little as possible? What motivations determined what you said? And since this is a very short form piece, why did you choose the words you chose?)
