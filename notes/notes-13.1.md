# 13.1 - This Machine Kills

Welcome back, comrades! Today we'll discuss generative AI, creative writing, and social justice... including how, apart from specific types of bounded, regulated AI agents that you know how to program, modify, and dismantle, GenAI is incompatible with creative writing and activism.

A quick writing exercise to get you thinking in the weird, associative ways that this story uses: Name two things you think should have a relationship, and offer no explanation. Then, reply to the person above you with a potential explanation for how those two things are related, in your mind.

Before we even begin talking about Ken Liu's "50 Things Every AI Working with Humans Should Know," it's important to know the following: the author used to work as a software engineer and lawyer, so he's familiar with the ethical quandaries and legal problems surrounding GenAI; and this story was written using a simple deep-learning neural network that the author hand-coded and trained only on all the fiction he had ever written and nothing else, then executed the program to generate snippets of text based on "seed" words and phrases he provided &mdash; e.g., winter, books, hope, sunlight, "a story about the world that we're about to inherit." This collaboration between Ken Liu, about 10% of the text in the final draft came from the neural network, which he dubbed robo_ken. Interestingly, most of the neural network's output was in the list of advice; most of the gibberish was human-authored because &mdash; as Liu notes &mdash; counterintuitively, it takes a human to write convincingly like a machine. 

**Q.** What lines feel predictive of the current GenAI moment in which we find ourselves?

Liu uses the AI figure itself to voice criticisms of the AI industry: "For reasons that remain impenetrable until this day, WHEEP-3 tended to be at its sharpest when targeting the nascent industry of human AI-trainers, delivering multiple barbs against the failings of this poorly regulated, would-be profession: stagnating visualization tools; lack of transparency concerning data sources; a focus on automated metrics rather than deep  understanding; willful blindness when machines have taken shortcuts in the dataset divergent from the real goal; grandiose-but-unproven claims about what the trainers understood; refusal to acknowledge or address persistent biases in race, gender, and other dimensions; and most important: not asking whether a task is one that should be performed  by AIs at all."

Liu's story is fiction in the shape of an AI agent's obituary and a warning to us in the "real world" about the unchecked proliferation of GenAI tools and how they get used in ways that outsource your capacity for thought and emotional diversity that make advocacy work possible to begin with. It enacts the lack of attribution that AI tools are known for: e.g., literary references to *Blade Runner* and *Imago*. The author's decision to anthropomorphize GenAI is intended to influence how readers think about responsibility within GenAI systems, and the constant reversals in reasoning and truthful admission destabilize our sense of reality and authenticity, much like GenAI does.

In interviews and in his work advising the Author's Guild and Copyright Office, Liu has said that "today's AI tech can't generate prose to challenge that of the writers (he) admires because its prime directive is to be understood, not interesting. Great writers invent their own language." In the story itself, we read of WHEEP-3's (Dr. Weep's) retirement, then the history of its development, including early false starts, glitches, criticisms, the story of its creator Jody Reynolds Tran, followed by the list of the "50 Things" that every AI working with humans should know.

One thing machine-generated writing can do for us is remind us how we make meaning &mdash; the sorts of things that are actually new and profound as opposed to being that way on the surface only &mdash; what lines in the list of advice, for instance, seem to make sense but whose meaning ultimately escapes you? For instance, "I never expected to sell my rational numbers" &mdash; where might we find meaning here?

**Q.** In your #team channels, choose 4 lines from the list of advice that felt compelling to you and try to collaboratively identify where and how you make sense of each line. What words do you pay special attention to? What happens with your thinking in the space between words, regarding their juxtaposition?

Looking ahead, we have two very short readings left on the calendar and the remainder of the *Dwelling* solo journaling game, with the rest of the time dedicated to text-only/async sessions and writing and revision time. I highly recommend you plan to make use of those class session hours to work on your project and consult with me to make sure that what you're writing is in fact emulating the technique you want it to, since this is what a significant part of your course grade will come from!
