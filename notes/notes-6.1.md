# 6.1 - The Researcher's Tools

Welcome back, comrades! We're more than a third of the way through so I wanted to ask how you’re taking care of yourselves this semester.

One thing to remember while reading Teju Cole's "What It Is" is that the memeification of politics is intrinsically dangerous &mdash; currently widespread and damaging in the political climate today. Memes in politics remove context and promote nihilism while undermining empathy and compassion. Memeifying politics encourages people to be unserious about politics and accept crisis and systemic oppression as the de facto reality, something inevitable. It also perpetuates the erosion of media literacy and reading-related literacies, because context matters. Surrounding environment, history, timeframe. Turning politics (or news events) into entertainment doesn't deepen understanding and turns social justice issues into levity and opportunities to create binary division and dunk on the opposition. 

The news headlines that Cole is riffing on &mdash; the ones that use the language of interminable hand-wringing over crisis, the nuanced language of lack of effort, catchy and endlessly repeatable and sensational clickbait &mdash; the satirical versions operate in the same way as their original inspirations. Form and content here work together to satirize this effect and in doing so explicitly calls attention to how these headlines function &mdash; both in the empty rhetoric and the "dinner table" or "social media" phrases weaving the "headlines" together. It mocks people who treat seriousness as performative. 

This essay is referencing a CNN interview during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak, where the chyron read: "Ebola: The ISIS of Biological Agents?" Domestic media coverage can shape public perceptions of a crisis and international response, and it can be argued that the ludicrous gearmongering hyperbole of U.S. news led to slow international response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014. This satire references the unself-awareness of the original interview.

Several rhetorical structures reference the conversational, dialogic tone of news stations or podcasts, where narrativization and in-group identification are enough to present something as though it's credible: for instance, the "some say" structure is a way of implying you have credible sources but suggesting simultaneously that you don't because you aren't sharing them. Phrases that stitch together the "X of Y" comparisons include: "Folks, this thing is serious," "In layperson's terms," "Look, I'm not the politically correct type," and "I'm not going to lie to you."

**Q.** Why use phrases like these?
**Q.** Why end with these lines: "We'll go to the phones in a moment and get your take on this. But first let me open the discussion up to our panel and ask whether Ebola is merely the Fox News of explosive incontinence, or whether the situation is much worse than that and Ebola is, in fact, the CNN of CNN."
