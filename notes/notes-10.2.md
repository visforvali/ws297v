# Guided Workshop

*Lecture notes posted after class!*


## *Auspex* 

### The Divergence

Once each visitor has had their reading and your predictions have been made, it is time for the world to change. The world is shifting, those who visited you are seeding change and destruction into the world until it will be unrecognizable in such a short time. 

*Choose and answer three of the following questions to remake your world:*

- *There is one who rises triumphant from the disorder.* Who, of all your visitors, emerges as a victor in the new world?
- *With a new future ahead, fear and hope bubbles up in equal portions.* What new emotions do the change evoke? Love? Hate? Curiosity? Fear?
- *Those that look back on a world they never knew cannot fathom the past.* What will generations yet to come think of this change?
- *The world unrecognizable, they wish to become unseen in this new world.* Who of your visitors retreats from this changing world?
- *All things die, man and animal alike. Even ideas and eras have their demise.* What dies with the past?
- *Places, people, like bodies, hold a memory.* What part of the world is irreparably scarred?
- *A blaze brings rich soil, from which strong blooms blossom.* What grows from the ashes in this new world?
- *The way we tell it to ourselves, that is the way history is made.* How has history changed?
- *A place, a planet, a people, all these can yearn.* What does the world want for itself?

### Ending

In a few sentences, using the prompting questions, sum up the new world that comes to be. It ends how it begins, unfathomable but simple. With the last sentence written, you may close your journal, leaving the new world to continue on its own. Until one day, another change may come.

### A Final Note on Reading Tarot

A note on reading tarot: When interpreting the cards, we find connections between the cards and their representative elements, and connections between all the cards in the whole spread. These examples aim to illustrate how you can build an interpretation by connecting the idea of the card represented in the spread to the card meaning keywords andrelating it back to the question being asked. Each suit has a theme, and each card has a meaning, or keywords associated with it. If you are unfamiliar with the meanings behind tarot cards, any instructional website or book will suffice to provide you with the keywords and basic interpretations. Tarot spreads are a constellation, all elements are part of a whole image and connect with one another. The cumulative interpretations can be used to divine an answer. When reading, think about the connections between the cards when forming your final interpretation. 

## Guided Workshop

*Follow the steps below before we meet next Thursday.*

After you've completed *Auspex*, we'll do an informal peer workshop! In your #team channels, post 1-2 entries from *Belluae/Venatores (Beast/Hunter)* and 1-2 entries from *Auspex*. Make sure each entry is labeled with the game title and day/game session, i.e. *B/V* Stage 3 (Beast), or *Auspex* Day 2. Don't include your choices for the beast or hunter, your tarot spread selections in *Auspex*, or your any "free" journaling prompt choices given in either game.

Then, skim each other's pieces without commenting, then read them closely a second time, paying special attention to craft. 

Answer the following questions in a reply to each of your teammates in #team:

1. Each of these game sessions gave you options (characteristics, tarot spreads) and asked you to make a choice. What do you think the writer's choices were for each game session, and what in the text lets you infer that?
2. From a craft perspective, what feels especially compelling to you and why?
3. From a craft perspective, what feels weak, or like a stretch, or otherwise takes you out of the narrative (rather than immersing you in it further) and why?
4. What craft techniques if any is the writer borrowing or experimenting with from the readings, and which readings? How are each of these techniques working on you as the reader, and why do you think that's the case?
5. What craft techniques is the writer not using that would be an effective vehicle for the content of their pieces? Why do you think so?
6. How might the writer adapt these for inclusion in their final project? What in the texts suggests this to you?
