# 8.1 - The Helicopter Story...

## TTRPG: *Auspex* 

**Worldbuilding and Day 1**

Our next TTRPG is called Auspex. In Auspex, we'll play out a week of divination practice, creating and responding to the visitors that come to you. Each day a visitor comes with a question they need answering, and each visitor gives you a look into what their future holds. To keep our stories somewhat thematically consistent, I'll do the tarot draws for you and share pictures of the tarot card spreads, but how you interpret them will be up to you.

Through drawing cards, I'll generate a visitor for you each session and will give you a choice between two tarot spreads from the game I prepared in advance. You can only use the spreads generated for class. You'll use the imagery of the cards, the themes represented by the card, and the meaning of the card's position in the spread to interpret the answers to their questions. How you interpret the spreads will determine the answers you give your visitors. You'll write down what you tell them, what you predict (or decide) their future will be. In short, you'll journal about the visitor, their question, the spread, your interpretations, the answer you give, and answer a daily question about your visitor offered by the cosmos. You'll continue until the week is over &mdash; i.e. 7 sessions of gameplay. 

When the week is over and you have no more visitors, the world will change. Once all seven of your visitors have been seen, reflect on the change each of them will usher in. You'll determine how the world will change by reflecting on your notes about the people you saw and the way your answers leaned. The world has many ways to change &mdash; revolution, natural disaster, war, industry, exploration, evolution, or a new social movement blooming &mdash; but you might want to try to make it linked to the social justice issue your course end-of-semester project will revolve around.

Through drawing cards, I'll generate a visitor for you each session, and will give you a team-specific tarot spread from the game I prepared in advance. You can only use the spread generated for your team. You'll use the imagery of the cards, the themes represented by the card, and what the placement of the card is in the spread to interpret the answers to their questions. How you interpret the spreads will determine the answers you give your visitors. You'll write down what you tell them, what you predict (or decide) their future will be. While the world would rather forget you exist, you refuse to forget exactly what the world is as told by the people who see you. Their secrets and their desires are as much a fortune as the coins they pay you. You note their presents and pasts so that you can continue to pull the strings of their futures, long after they have left your dwelling. 

In short, you'll journal about the visitor, their question, the spread, your interpretations, the answer you give, and answer a daily question about your visitor offered by the cosmos.

Once you've given them their reading, you'll answer the questions from the universe about how they play a larger part in the shifting tides. Note that down in your journal. When you are done with the first visitor, move on to the next, choosing a spread and reading the cards for them to determine their fate. All while writing your observations, your predictions, and what they will change in the world. You'll continue until the week is over, i.e., 7 sessions of gameplay.

When the week is over and you have no more visitors, the world will change. Once all seven of your visitors have been seen, reflect on the change each of them will usher in. You'll determine how the world will change by reflecting on your notes about the people you saw and the way your answers leaned. The world has many ways to change &mdash; revolution, natural disaster, war, industry, exploration, evolution, or a new social movement blooming &mdash; but you might want to try to make it linked to the social justice issue your course end-of-semester project will revolve around.

**Introduction**


Underneath a bustling metropolis, shadows slink and slither. A world of creatures of tooth and fang who live underneath footsteps and crave a day in the light. That day comes when a sinkhole opens in the middle of the city and every shadow creature crawls out into the new world and into the light, to the panic and demise of those that live around them.

In this world, you are an outcast, but with a gift those who wish you ill desire above all else. The gift of foresight. Your power upholds an uneasy balance, a strained alliance, and the world is unaware of the changes to come, but you are. The world is about to change, about to end, literally or figuratively. An end of an era or an end of existence as we know it. You are the only one who can foresee it, you are the only one who can divert the paths of fate, if you so choose to. There are only seven days until the world will become something unrecognizable. 

Each day, someone new will come seeking their future, fortune, or an answer from the beyond. Each individual's future entangled with the future of the new world. As your visitors ask their questions, the cards will offer up their answers. The cards will never lie. You, on the other hand, are free to lie at your own discretion...

While the world would rather forget you exist, you refuse to forget exactly what the world is as told by the people who see you. Their secrets and their desires are as much a fortune as the coins they pay you. You note their presents and pasts so that you can continue to pull the strings of their futures, long after they have left your dwelling. 

Give them what they want, steer them down a brighter path, or lean into the chaos of the shifting world; regardless, you will guide this world to its end and usher in the birth of a new one.

# I Sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter (aka Helicopter Story)

The title of Isabel Fall's debut story "I Sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter" is derived from the harmful transphobic meme that it then goes on to deeply critique by simulating its reality. We'll talk more about that later; for now, let's focus on the story itself. It was briefly published in Clarkesworld sci-fi magazine before being pulled. It takes the meme, a transphobic "joke," and writes it into being, literally &mdash; leveraging critiques of the military-industrial complex, climate destruction, and gender stereotypes to do so. One of its central arguments is that Power and War will coopt anything it deems remotely strategic, even at the expense of soldiers' and civilians' well-being, if it means gaining a military advantage. The science-fiction and speculative elements become a springboard for an exploration of biology, sociology, psychology, and the distribution of power and how, when, and why we might assimilate into and perpetuate these power structures. Good sci-fi takes a speculative technology, setting, and future to aim a critical lens back at our own current society and institutional structures. 

Fall's story follows a helicopter pilot who undergoes brainwashing and gender reassignment from "woman" to "combat aircraft" as she/it/they conduct a tactical mission with its gunner. (In talking about the story, incidentally, it's interesting to note the absence of current pronouns; I'll switch between she, they, and it as a result but recognize even this limits what Fall intended.) The story plays with gender identity, the militarization of the body, and identity and intimacy in a world buckling under the strain of climate change, imperialism, and unchecked black-box technologies like AI. By pushing the idea of the hurtful meme to its most illogical extreme, "Helicopter Story" recontextualizes our assumptions of gender and reveals new truths about how it's constructed and how we fall in line, or don't.

In a nutshell, the plot is as follows: In the future, the U.S. abandoned the Gulf Coast after climate, disease, and economic catastrophes; an AI originally trained to manage a credit union retrained itself to assume governance, and since the program can no longer be controlled, the U.S. is at war with it. We follow Barb and Axis, both of whom consented to "tactical role gender reassignment" to "attack helicopter," where warfare is part of their gender expression. Parallels are drawn between the expression of femininity and the expression of warfare, and the places where the two overlap. By the end, we learn that Axis has begun experiencing gender dysphoria, which should be impossible. In this world, this should be completely impossible, since scientists have unlocked the secrets of neurological "gender choice." 

Barb could be a gender essentialist for how firmly they assert their "helicopter" identification. Because their gender role in society has changed, they're now part of a new gender discourse, with a new set of roles and acts. Barb seems freed from being a docile woman trying to fulfill the demands of internalized power. 

The question we're left with is this: Is it that Barb was specifically dissatisfied with being a woman, and satisfied with being an attack helicopter? Or has nothing internal changed, and what has changed is the external perception and expectation of them that lets them perform their gender however they choose?
