# 12.1 - A Tender Apocalypse

"Inventory" is from Carmen Maria Machado's debut collection, *Her Body and Other Parties*, which begins with a long nostalgic list of lovers and the circumstances in which the narrator formed her sexual connections, and turns into a viral apocalyptic landscape. It's an especially interesting story to read during the COVID-19 pandemic. The narrator omits personally identifying details &mdash; just one man, one woman, minor characteristics, and a short bit of context. She's clearly confident in her sexuality, and we see her confidence grow as time passes in her list, until she gets married, the virus begins to spread, it becomes clear the virus is spread through physical contact and is killing millions, but she continues to travel, meet new people, and have sex. She seems most in love with her last partner. People filter through the cottage but this woman stays, pointing to a relationship that's more than just sexual, until this woman catches the virus and dies. Only then does the narrator institute a quarantine, and she begins to list everyone she has encountered who either made a difference to her or made her feel less alone. It's reminiscent of a contact tracing list, which fits this pandemic world.

At its core, there are two warring tensions in this story: the desire to be with people and pursue individual, selfish desires, and the duty we have towards collective care. The desire for other people and the desire to survive.

A CDC director notes, "if people would just stay apart" the virus could have been avoided. It's a prescient story because this is where we find ourselves today. And after such irreversible folly, what's left is memory and loneliness. From a craft perspective, the story is straightforward and economical with its words. As a result, even insignificant details about the narrator's sexual partners seem to carry weight. The title manifests throughout the story: an inventory of a life, of contact tracing, of sexual partners, embodied action &mdash; the narrator emphasizes factual details, what happened, over subjective introspection about what she felt about it. 

There's an easy parallel between "Inventory," written before a pandemic became commonplace and the COVID-related disregard for science and empathy that settled around masks and vaccines. In a world where everyone is so desperate for connection, contact, and release, people can't stay apart.
