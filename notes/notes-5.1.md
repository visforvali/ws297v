# 5.1 - The Contemporary Epic

Welcome back, comrades! Choose a two-page spread in the used book you obtained for the class and black out only the words you love. On the next two pages, blackout only the words you hate. How would you characterize what's left?

Now for an excerpt from Alice Notley's *The Descent of Alette*, a feminist epic that parallels Dante's *Inferno* in many ways, as its protagonist, Alette, finds herself on a subway traveling deeper into some unknown subterranean realm that's also the only thing its riders seem to know, at the mercy of "'a tyrant' 'a man in charge of' 'the fact' 'that we were' 'below the ground' 'endlessly riding' 'our trains' 'never surfacing' 'A man who would make you pay' 'so much' 'to leave the subway' / 'that you don’t' 'ever ask' 'how much it is' 'it is, in effect' 'all of you, & more.'"

Notley herself described her poems as creating "a beginning space. I always seem to be erasing and starting over, rather than picking up where I left off, even if I wind up taking the same themes. This is probably one reason that I change form and style so much, out of a desire to find a new beginning, which is always the true beginning." 

I'll read some of Notley's thoughts about her work in her own words: 

"For a long time I've seen my job as bound up with the necessity of noncompliance with pressures, dictates, atmospheres of, variously, poetic factions, society at large, my own past practices as well... It seemed one had to disobey the past and the practices of literary males in order to talk about what was going on most literally around me... *The Descent of Alette* was for me an immense act of rebellion against dominant social forces, against the way a poem was supposed to look, according to both past and contemporary practice... [The narrator's] important name is I. I stand with this, and with the urgency that saying I creates, a facing up to sheer pressure, death and responsibility, the potential for blowing away all the gauze... That the self means I and also means poverty, it's what one strips down to, who you are when you're stripped down... More and more as I wrote, I discovered I couldn't go along, with the government or governments, with radicals and certainly not with conservatives or centrists, with radical poems and certainly not with other poetics, with other women's feminisms, with any fucking thing at all; belonging to any of it was not only an infringement on my liberty but a veil over clear thinking... It's necessary to maintain a state of disobedience against everything... One must remain somehow, though how, open to any subject or form in principle, open to the possibility of liberty, open to the possibility of using... I think I conceive of myself as disobeying my readership a lot."

Finally, Notley describes it as an "immense act of rebellion against dominant social forms, against the fragmented forms of modern poetry, against the way a poem was supposed to look according to both past and contemporary practice."

The quotation marks around poetic "pieces" serve to slow the reader down. This excerpt opens with: "'One day, I awoke' '& found myself on' 'a subway, endlessly' 'a tyrant' 'a man in charge of' 'the fact' 'that we were' 'below the ground' 'endlessly riding' 'our trains, never surfacing' 'A man who' 'would make you pay' 'so much' 'to leave the subway' 'that you don’t' 'ever ask' 'how much it is' 'It is, in effect,' 'all of you, & more.'"

(*The Inferno* opens with: "Midway upon the journey of our life / I found myself within a forest dark, / for the straightforward pathway had been lost," as a point of comparison.)

Where do you locate the most overt feminist themes in this poem? Where do you locate a literary disobedience, a social disobedience, the convergence of both?
