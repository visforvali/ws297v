# 4.2 - What Tests Teach Us

Welcome back, comrades! Some housekeeping: As a reminder, my conception of attendance isn't passively, silently coming to class; it's posting your low-stakes questions in #classroom and actively talking or typing in our class sessions. If you don't contribute during class &mdash; if I won't remember you from anything you said that day &mdash; you're effectively absent. Check the Syllabus and Alt-Grading System on the website for more details.

So: the text we'll be discussing today, Desirae Matherly's "Final: Comprehensive, Roughly." But before we get down to it, I want to throw this question at you: What is immediately noticeable about or set up by this form? 
So: the text we'll be discussing today, Desirae Matherly's "Final: Comprehensive, Roughly." But before we get down to it, I want to throw this question at you: What is immediately noticeable about or set up by this form? 

"Final: Comprehensive, Roughly" uses the form of an exam, a traditional requirement in education and other credential-granting institutions, to interrogate exams as accurate measures of expertise or at least knowledge acquisition, what kinds of knowledge are considered worth acquiring, who (for reasons of discrimination, socioeconomic status, lack of exposure or inability to access ideas outside of particular ethnic or religious communities) is barred from knowledge-seeking and acquisition, and what questions are even worth asking. It suggests the real accusation in all exams is "Reveal to me how much this matters to you, because if you do not see the value of knowledge in and of itself, then you have no right to claim it" (p. 91).

Expertise is a myth, and mastery is tied to the same colonial legacies that the umiversity is founded on. Grades are an artificial measure of knowledge-acquisition and comprehension aimed at a comprehensiveness that is unattainable and can never measure how that learning is applied outside of the classroom. Matherly's text, through its form and slow alteration of expected conventions like test instructions and exam questions, tries to reveal that to readers &mdash; tries to get them to confront that knowledge and change their thinking. Which in the context of our class is in alignment with social justice imperatives.
 
Matherly herself says, "The form... sprang from the anxiety of having to study for and take my comprehensive doctoral exams. I thought, what I'm feeling right now is fear about answering my comp questions and completing my degree. There was so much self-doubt. Then I wondered what comprehensive even meant, because to my line of thinking, nothing could be that comprehensive. And then I wondered, why don't professors ever ask students the really hard questions, the ones that truly mean something and push one to learn and reflect? So I guess the form and the idea arose together."

The subversion of instructional expectations asks readers to reconfigure our relationships with writing &mdash; blotting out lines that are true, for instance, instead of the ones that are false, which requires writing over those truths so deeply they disappear. "Comprehensiveness is an impossibility, and only an impossible question can approach it" (pp. 90-91). 

The point is that readers are collaborators in the writing process and are absolutely relevant to the creation of a text &mdash; this is an extension of our previous discussion of interactivity in print- and multimodal texts. "Final: Comprehensive, Roughly" is designed as an exam to illustrate this point. The inclusion of song lyrics as answers, media like magic markers that tend to be used as children and in creative, not serious contexts, reference experiences that are universal but also individual. Matherly offers some of her own experiences as an "inner" narrative in a way that makes readers compare the text to their own experience to form an "outer" narrative, co-creating the story and its existential questions for which there are no answers. 

Polished or not, what are some impossible questions that came to you while reading? And did you jot them in the margins? And if you did or didn't, how does that make you judge yourself as a reader/writer/activist in this moment? 

This essay suggests: don't worry about failure when writing. Let the prose lead, then look for natural variations in form in your own instinctive choices, and decide how to proceed. "Final: Comprehensive, Roughly" shows what can happen when we experiment, which in instructional settings is too often linked to failure. And as for evaluating writing, that "How we evaluate the work we do must be the most private of all. Our labor transmits our secrets, if anyone would care to listen" (p. 87), because quantitative rubrics aren't adequate to the task of qualitative assessment, and instructors have to balance this fact &mdash; and the fact that grading turns knowledge-seeking into consumerism and can turn students into entitled and vindictive "grade-grubbers" &mdash; with a desire to not grade, in the way that grades have become (or always were) neoliberal, capitalist, ableist, racist, antifeminist metrics.

How do the directions orient you to this "test," and how do they differ from actual tests? What were your answers, and why? How did "If you suffer from test anxiety, go directly to Part IV" work on you? 

The rationale for the piece is actually seeded throughout the text, like "clues" that unravel why it's being set up this way: for instance, the section where every answer is a song lyric and then, much later, the influence of music on her writing. 

What did you do? In what order did you take the test? What do the answers tell you about yourself? How are they constructed in a way that tells you this?

Matherly also suggests the following writing exercise: "List a handful of worries that have been bothering you. Pick one, and think about a form of writing associated with that worry. It could be a medical history, a nutrition label, Google Maps directions, a FAFSA worksheet, a personal budget, a phone book. Note the characteristics of this writing mode. Use this structure in a playful way to explore what’s troubling you."

# *Belluae/Venatores* Stage 3

## B&V Stage 3: Beast 

The changes are slow and steady, your body relaxes into a lethargic stupor. You change slowly, you move slowly, you live slowly in these moments. While you waste and rot, your mind has time to wander. You are... (pick two):

- Melting
- Moulting
- Shedding
- Sloughing
- Rejecting
- Expelling
- Crusting
- Crystallizing
- Emanating
- Consuming
- Exuding
- Scattering

Write to your love about your relationship. Answer the corresponding prompts in your letter:

- What is something that you’ve always hated about them but couldn’t tell them?
- What fears do you have about how they would treat you differently as you are changing?
- How does the idea of them looking at you with fear make you feel?
- What do you imagine life could be like if they could accept the new you?
Knight — What is something you always wish you could’ve been honest about?

## B&V Stage 3: Hunter

You follow the tracks, barefoot tracks follow signs of destruction but no signs of a struggle or violence. In the night, you get a glimpse of the foul creature, something with the gestures of a human form, but deeply, deeply wrong. You see fragments of the beast. Pick three (one from each group):

**Group 1**: eyes, teeth, mouths, hands, limbs, hair, skin, feathers, fur, chitin, mineral, scales, wings
**Group 2**: claws, tails, metal, stone, wood, gills, beaks, snouts, fins, wings, spores, dust, gas
**Group 3**: ooze, clay, horns, hooves, leaves, flowers, blood, tears, cinder, mud, frost

The monster sees you too, and proceeds as follows:

- Circle. A looping path that keeps the other contained.
- Ponders. An observation leads to many thoughts.

while how you proceed as follows:

- Watch. A steady eye surveils and sees all.
- Lead. A confident stride that expects a follower.

Locked in this moment with the monster, you have a singular thought. Pick one reflection to elaborate on after the moment is gone:

- As you provide even a temporary distraction, is there a chance your love was able to flee?
- The monster stares you down, your eyes lock. What does it see in your eyes? Does it see a familiar violence?
- Locking eyes with the monster, you see a dark shimmer in those eyes, a coldness. What does your own reflection look like in those eyes?
- Even glimpsing this horrible form, you can't imagine what it would be like to be menaced by this creature. How could your love handle being held captive by something so horrible? What must they feel?
- You haven't seen the full creature yet, in all its enormity, but it must have a weak spot. What could it possibly be?
- Is there a chance your love is nearby? Could you find them? Could you make it to them in time before it finds them again?
- What made this creature? Part human, part wild, sick, animal. What part of nature went so terribly wrong to create this?
- There was a time you stared at yourself in the mirror after a fight and saw something monstrous looking back at you. How did you hurt your love? What had you done?
- One time you got a glimpse of your love, saw something dark and vulnerable about them, and it sickened you. How did you hurt them to soothe your own disgust?
- Looking at the monster's body, its horrid form, you imagine yourself changing, becoming something like that. Could you live with yourself as a monster?
