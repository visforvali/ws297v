# 15.1 - Leaving the Door Open 

**Instructions**: You were asked to do the worldbuilding and some initial writing in [Week 13](/notes/notes-12.2.md){:target="_blank"} and [Week 14](/notes/notes-14.2.md){:target="_blank"}.

I step into the living room and feel as if there's hot coals under my feet. I stop, take a step back and stand at the threshold of the room, not willing to
enter the room that no light seems to move through.

A door slams again. It's neither the door behind me nor is there any other visible door in my vicinity. The walls of the room shake at the impact of the
slams. My limbs feel turgid and electric, stuck in place. As if they were to move at all, they would move with great force, colliding into things with a destructive lack of focus. My heart beats in my chest and shakes my ribs, just as the slamming door shook the walls.

Another slam that rings so loud it is accompanied by the sound of cracking wood, I finally see the cause. It is summoned before me, accompanied by the loud boom. Eyes adjusting to the darkness, I realize the shadow looms in the room, pressed up into the ceiling and wall alike, filling the room with its presence. Its movement stifled by its cumbersome size, it swings wildly, limb like protrusions colliding with walls, furniture, and picture frames.

[*15 min writing interlude: What is the ghost/memory that has been summoned into this room? How did you summon it? Why this space? Why has it taken this form? Why has it appeared to you now, and why do you feel compelled to record it in writing?*]

Its mass moves wildly and frantically in its fury. The dark shape of one swings by my face and with it my vision goes dark, my mind instead filled with a memory
that feels too big, too loud to properly be projected within my mind. Sharp voices, the shouting, the tension in the room and in the stretches of spaces in between bodies. How distance could feel as loud as a shout. Doors slamming only to punctuate sentences, to end an argument. What even was all the anger for? Did anything ever make it stop? Or was it a matter of time? Heat in bodies and temperament alike needing time to cool off.

As fast as the memory was in my mind, it's gone completely, but the sounds remain. Unable to take the noise and the damage being done to my house, I move forward into the living room, preparing myself to scream over the pounding and static and the echo of a bellowing roar.

I take one step into the living room and it all stops. The room shifts in tone. It's brighter, as the thing that filled the room shrinks into a small cluster of dark shadows in the corner of the room. It's quiet again. I can still feel the reverberations of the sound in the floorboards through my feet but the sound itself is gone. The room is undamaged. The house is quiet again and I slump into the wall &mdash; letting myself breathe and feel my heart rate pound back to normal. I feel the mark of tension stretching across some part of me, a taught bundle of nerves ready to snap.

I attempt to ease out the tension in my body and rest, letting my body go slack in its place on the floor. 

As my body settles, and I feel the new extremities of it, the sound of a singular heartbeat resonates throughout the house, breaking the silence, in each and every empty room.

[*15 min writing interlude: How has this haunting "marked" you, i.e. how are you forever changed by remembering and recording this ghost?*]
