# 3.1 - Intimacy, Cruelty, Unknowability... and Work

Welcome, comrades. Before we get into it today, don't forget to reply to my DM if I asked you what your IRL identity is for enrollment verification purposes. Also, I've met with and DM'd with a few of you by now, so it feels like a good time to repeat how I always frame my discussions with students, no matter what, as a matter of effective pedagogy: 

{: .important }
> Before I explain something for you or attempt to answer your questions, I'll always ask you to first explain your reasoning to me, i.e. where you found information, how you interpreted assignment guidelines, what your takeaways from relevant class sessions were, what other work you did to arrive at your understanding (things you looked up, observations about your peers' work), and so on. 

This isn't meant to put you on the spot, shame you, "make you do all the work," or "be rude," but I recognize it can make people feel that way if they have an insecure relationship with or feel entitled about the process of learning. Learning never happens by just being told something, but by failing your way through it, enacting it, repeating it, habituating it.

We'll continue with our tabletop game session after we talk about the reading a little.

"If a Book is Locked There's Probably a Good Reason for That Don't You Think" appears in *What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours*, a short story collection that revolves around keys, locks, and books. Helen Oyeyemi, a British Nigerian novelist, often uses genre-defying, fantastical fiction &mdash; imaginative or speculative or philosophical &mdash; to explore identity, transformation, disruption, myth, and folklore across a variety of stories. In the collection, keys are mysteries, gifts, threats, doors in and of themselves, invitations, orphans that have yet to find their locks, or maybe don't have locks as counterparts at all. 

"If a Book is Locked" is like a fable about modern office work staged around a question about keys, locks, books, and the purpose of all three. "Is a key's intention to keep contents sealed and inaccessible or does a key ultimately seek to free the content locked away?" Regardless of the answer, keys have power. 

As Oyeyemi says elsewhere, keys are impressions of the locks they were made for, and thus convey a sense of the building using such locks. There's a difference between the building that uses keycards, the building that uses tumbler locks, and the padlocked door. We tend to think of the locked book the same way we think about anything under lock and key: something valuable and secret that must be kept safe, as though the act of locking-up is an act of safe-keeping. The secrecy narrative about keys and locks absorb them into capitalist reasoning, in a way: we lock up wealth rather than disseminate it.

Take the secrecy narrative away, though, and there are other, less easily articulated reasons to lock a book. In the background of this story is a question like that: "How do you approach, mentally or physically, a locked book?" "The building of Eva's quietness" surrounds the lock that locks the diary (which contains rhetorical questions that reflect common struggles with misogyny). The similarly reserved, mysterious grandmother's fingers that unlock it give an impression of the key that might be needed. 

What kind of key might that be? What are the possible reasons for locking the diary, if not secrecy? Is the reason the thing that matters? And if not, where did our fixation on The Reason come from?

The act of reading (whether intentionally or accidentally) is also ambiguously framed &mdash; the narrator might not intend to read the diary but an open book will not be contained. 

What does language lock? What does writing, or reading, unlock? 

Keys that fit their locks don't always provide a resolution, and sometimes raise more questions. "If a Book is Locked" is written in the second-person, features a data interpreter who winds up with the locked diary of her coworker Eva, is exposed to its contents, and returns it, only to learn that the reason it was locked wasn't secrecy. Readers are left wondering: "So what *was* the reason?" But we aren't given an answer &mdash; that lock stays locked.

Setting all these questions in a modern workplace, in a study of office productivity and office politics and how they change after a new employee is hired, is a choice. It's an everyday situation that most people would prefer to deny &mdash; that all workplaces are afflicted with politics and targeted (misogynist, racist) harassment like this &mdash; that's subverted by a fairytale or "extra-fictional" ending that provides no resolution, ending explicitly with a question, intentionally designed to leave us with a sense of confusion, curiosity, and frustration. This frustration is supposed to tell us something about us, not the story. What did it tell you? What's the story being told? What's gained by telling it this way? What makes the fantastical twist at the end needed?

The duality of a key is apparent and enacted in the craft: for instance, the work is saturated with an us/them binary in the use of "you" (self or other, depending how you read it), fools who need eloquence for belief and those who don't, the number of two-part compound sentences (joined by "and" or "but"), Eva's black-and-white status in the office (from universally admired to abhorred), rhetorical questions about the commonplaces of our daily (work) lives, like "Is it the job that’s doing this to you all or do these games get played no matter what the circumstances?" (p. 6). 

There's also something interesting about journaling and productivity culture happening here. Its antithetical to work to keep a diary, a "frivolous" pursuit. The diary traditionally records the humdrum events of life along with a snapshot of how the diarist is feeling at that point in time, as a mode of self-preservation and relational preservation. The modern office is designed to optimize productivity, not nurture personality or personal development. Planners and journals get combined more and more in physical notebooks these days, further blurring the line between the personal and productivity culture's demands. What's better, the record of a life lived through "wasted time" or of how productive you were at work under capitalism's mandate?

**Discussion Question**

How did the week's prompts help you better understand how the story works, from a content and craft perspective? What lines feel most like they unlock this story for you, craft-wise, and why? What do the following lines do to you:

# *Belluae/Venatores*: Hunter - Introduction

They were gone before you knew what happened. Your home torn apart, clothes, furniture, mementos scattered all over as if someone was searching for something. Only a few traces of them remain: a few shirts askew on hangers, broken picture frames, a bathroom left untouched in the destruction, each item an afterthought, and a single handwritten letter. It's incoherent, almost incomprehensible, but you understand one thing: something has taken them. Some strange and foul creature stole the love of your life from you, infected them and caused them to flee. Without them your life will only be in as much disarray as your home, as your mind, as that letter. You know you cannot lose them, and so you grab what you can, and you prepare yourself to hunt.

You spend your moments in preparation recalling your love's strange behaviors and distance before their disappearance. How did evil seep into your home? You hatch a plan: you will prepare, you will track this creature down, and you will kill it. Everything you do now is for this singular purpose, to end this foul beast and to bring your love back home.

There is only a single trail of where they went, but you are determined to find them, to rescue them and bring them home, and to kill the foul creature that has taken them from you. Nothing will stop you from getting them back or getting revenge. You are even prepared to lose your life.

# *Belluae/Venatores*: Hunter - Stage 1

If you don't want to lose the trail of where they went, you have to leave quickly. Grab a weapon. Pick one and note it in your journal:

- rifle
- bowie knife
- crossbow
- baseball bat
- meat cleaver
- crowbar
- tire iron
- machete
- hammer
- axe

Grab two items as well: 

- flashlight
- duct tape
- rope
- gloves
- map
- a photo of you and your love
- your wallet
- extra clothes
- a sentimental piece of jewelry
- a sleeping bag
- first aid kit

This is your first journal entry of the day. Your adrenaline is still surging and you are wandering blindly out into the world. Write what you take, about what you wish you didn't have to leave behind, and where you think they could have possibly been taken.

(You might also want to note your thought process for yourself, e.g. why did you choose the weapon and items you chose? How did you answer those questions in your journal entry? How much or how little did you write, and what might the length of the journal entry indicate about your state of mind?)
