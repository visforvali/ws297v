# 14.1 - Virality

Welcome back, comrades!

It feels important to close out the class with an examination of language, as the way we language things is critical to influencing perspectives on social justice issues. Both of these texts employ and/or analyze interactive forms and formats, Ray uses short quiz form to satirize the treatment of vaccines and PPE by presumably many of his students and the university administration, and Hedva et al. uses a webtext in the form of a plain greeting card and an archive of illness-related GoFundMe comments, divorced from their original charitable context. Both these texts are responding to the COVID pandemic. 

As Hedva writes about the crisis of American healthcare, made worse by COVID: "The language of illness is a language of platitudes... The language of revolutions is also one of platitudes... When we are desperate for change, as we are both in illness and insurrection, our language drains of complexity, becomes honed to its barest essentials. We feel we cannot waste time with adjectives or similes or hypotaxis. No, we have a message to get across, and it's crucial and immediate; we can't afford to risk its meaning getting lost in too many words. As illness and revolution persist, though, the language made in them and about them deepens."

**Q.** How did you feel/respond to the archive of illness-related platitudes?

Take 10 minutes to write a list of platitudes you default to when faced with someone else's illness? When trying to respond to someone's platitudes about your own?

**Q.** Where is the line between spareness of language and minimalism that conveys the limits of experience and a livable world, versus a mundane expression that has traded authenticity for tokenism or virtue signaling? 

The title of Ray's piece, similarly, tells us about its inspiration &mdash; the students who seem indifferent or uncaring to their instructors' health when asked to wear PPE, as well as to their classmates and their own health. Ray said in an interview, "I'm a professor in a red state whose leadership has basically embraced the virus and given up on mitigation. As a professor at a research university that purports to be devoted to knowledge and evidence, I was struck by the absurdity of the anti-science policy being forced on us by political apparatuses... I thought gallows humor and ridicule better captured the feeling of being forced to teach with minimal protections than the straightforward facts of an op-ed." 

**Q.** What is the effect of that choice on the reader? Which lines especially felt like a confrontation and what in the language made you feel that way? 

**Q.** What are your answers to Ray's quiz questions?
