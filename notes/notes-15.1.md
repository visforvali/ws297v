# 15.1 - Haunted Memories

# *Dwelling* Room 4

**Instructions**: You were asked to do the worldbuilding and some initial writing in [Week 13](/notes/notes-12.2.md){:target="_blank"} and [Week 14](/notes/notes-14.2.md){:target="_blank"}.

I move from my place in the hallway towards my own bedroom, back to bed to sleep and hopefully my head will be rid of this haze by the morning. My eyes start to sag with the exhaustion of being awake after such little sleep. I step into the door when another sound enters my aural periphery, different from the scratching before.

The creaking of a door hinge.

I freeze, listening for any other sounds of movement from downstairs, floorboards creaking or anything that might denote more danger than sudden strange noises in the night. Moving closer to the edge of the landing, I listen for the sound again, looking for any movement downstairs.

Nothing.

No movement and the creaking stops once I finally pause to listen for it. After a few moments of waiting I decide to check downstairs to make sure I hadn't left any windows open causing a draft to move through the house. With the strange moment in the guest room lingering in my mind, I feel I would sleep easier knowing there will be no more strange sounds happening throughout the night. 

With my mind made up, I grip the handrail at the top of the stairs and begin my first few steps down...

Standing at the top of the stairs I move slowly, step by step, 13 steps down, treading lightly to make minimal noise but also as if each footfall was a meditation. Each step, a recounting of the bits and pieces of my day before I went up to bed.

Each step, written with the logical procession of events of my day, a list of happenings up until now. A day, filled with things... I woke up...

[*15 min writing interlude: Make a chronological list of 13 things, one for each step, that have haunted you today. What gives them their haunting quality? Why do you feel compelled to record them in writing?*]

And then I'm there, on the main floor, standing in the dark listening for the sound of another errant creak in the pitch black. My feet hit the firmness of the first floor and I shake from my head the catalogue of what I'd done today. Perhaps in those in between moments there was a chance where I forgot to close a window or, worse, lock a door.

Looking to my left towards the entrance I see a shut door, likely locked, but for certain not the culprit of squeaky hinges. I look right, towards the back of the house, through the kitchen and towards the dining room where the back door also sits firmly closed. Sweeping my eyes across the floor plan of the first floor, I can't tell if any of the windows look open in the darkness. I stand and watch the curtains, waiting for the movement from a breeze. Nothing.

I keep going down.

Each step down the wobbly uneven staircase into the pitch black basement creates an ever-widening distance between me and the safety of the first floor, only moving me closer to the unknowns of what hides in the basement.

With each step, I remember the gut-drop anticipation I felt going down into the basement as a child, trying to move in and out as fast as possible, unsure of what lurked in its shadows, what dangerous monstrous things lurked out of sight?

Each time I went down, a new creature would be imagined, each step would conjure a new fantastical monster to the point where the basement seemed to hold multitudes of horrors. Each entity, a jumble of features in my mind, too frightened to put a picture to the words.

I begin to wonder, would I find down there now?

[*15 min writing interlude: What haunting memories and apparitions lurk in the basement of this haunted house? What gives them their haunting quality? Why do you feel compelled to record them in writing?*]

I shake my head, feeling foolish at my list of childhood horrors and wild imagination. Still something doesn't sit well in my guts about what still haunts the dark corners of my mind ever since youth. Reaching the bottom, I realize I'm running. My feet plodding along the cold concrete floor as I rush into the middle of the room and grasp the light string and pull on it hard, as if by turning on the light I will banish every horrible thought and monster from my mind.

The basement is bathed in a sickly red glow. Everything I imagined from the most fear drenched moments of my childhood are summoned here in the basement around me. Bodies, forms, beings etched into shadow, and wall, floor, and even the red light that is spreading throughout the basement.

Each imposing form brings with it a memory of every basement, crawl space, dark place that they lived and hid and lurked. Walls and stairs appear in the dark corners of the room, the basement becoming a jumble of rooms overlapping with one another, the shadow geometry intersecting at odd angles.

A windy chill runs across my skin. Somewhere on my body I am marked by a small feeling of dread, and no other sensation for a few moments until I hear the creaking of a door. I open my eyes, unsure of how long they were closed or how long I’ve been standing here. The door into the basement slowly opens, its rusted hinges squeaking and groaning as the wood slowly shifts in the frame.

From my position in the hallway I can only see the first step down into the basement from the darkness. The door opens wide before me, a strong breeze rushes up the basement stairs and the door caught in the gust slams shut in front of me. The sound resounds throughout the house.

I don't know how I got back upstairs. I look around placing myself in relation to everything else in the house. To my left the door to the living room and from there I start scanning clockwise through the rest of the rooms in the house. In front of me the basement door, next to it the stairs trailing off to the second floor. Down a hallway to my right the dining room as it opens up into the kitchen. Above me is the hallway on the second floor that leads to my room and the guest room. Underneath me is the open expanse of the basement, that I swear I was just in, that was filled with monsters, but I'm here standing in front of the door to the basement again, just as I was a moment ago.
