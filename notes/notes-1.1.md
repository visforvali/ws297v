# 1.1 - On Craft and Social Justice

September 2, 2025: The weather drapes a sleek, thermobaric flank on one side of today and a chilled muzzle on the other, a metaphor meant to make you feel something critical about the mundane activity of gathering for class in a university setting. Barely a phrase, but it has an internal logic, a politics, a poetics, which I list separately for clarity's sake but which are as entangled as our veins and nerves. Or nerves and veins. Which logically says the same thing but affectively does not. What you learned in elementary school mathematics is true here. The order of operations matters. So do the variables. So does the ability to reverse-engineer a proof. Both writing and activism are about strategically breaking rules. Whether stylistic choice or ideology, you can't do this without first knowing what those rules are. 

Do you feel a little uncertain, a little yes-my-curiosity-has-been-piqued, a little excited, a little filled with dread, confused? Good. 

How many points of interest have you jotted down so far, I say points of interest instead of notes because notes has come to mean "what I think I'll be tested on" instead of "what I, myself, want to know, what catches my attention for as-of-now unknown reasons that I can only figure out if I write them down."

I want to welcome you to WS 297V: Feminist Disability Justice. Call me Dr. Mani. I'm an Eelam Tamil American. I've had chronic pain and fatigue for 20 years, taught for 19, written for 30, and have published work in creative and scholarly forums that in part enacts resistance by resisting classification itself. Online, you can call me my server name, Legendary Boon, a reference to the *Hades* video game series.

This course focuses on genres of resistance &mdash; particularly the lyric essay &mdash; and what it means to write for social justice. Part-webinar, part-roleplay, part-workshop, you'll be introduced to the elements of poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction through reading, writing, and individual and cooperative play. Since social justice writing is writing that does something to its audience, you'll regularly engage with, interpret (and create!) texts that model how content and form act together on readers. In doing so, you'll consider questions like: How have we been shaped, personally and politically, by reading and writing? How have systems of power and oppression shaped who and how we read; who and what we write about; how we compose and perceive our compositions; and which genres we consider "legitimate" genres? What potential impact can we &mdash; through what we write &mdash; have on our communities and institutions?

And of course, I can't introduce this class without acknowledging that the U.S. is in the grips of social upheaval that is contingent on a lack of knowledge, a lack of curiosity, an obstinacy towards learning, an unwillingness to listen to the elders who formed the political bodies of similar social movements before, media illiteracy, and the unchecked removal of women's, gender, and sexuality studies and antiracist curriculum from the education system. We're in the process of losing a free and open Internet under the guise of age verification legislation for pornography sites, which has already been used to ban minors from global politics and sex education forums and queer communities, because an uninformed populace is one that's easy to control.

The assigned readings and writing exercises aren't meant to make you feel like a better person, which is what "inspiring awareness and empathy" can mean around social justice. Resistance is grueling, often thankless feeling work that requires coalition building and the suppression of ego. Like Mariame Kaba says, hope is a discipline. We'll read, write, and play through building coalitions and kinds of hope and resistance in seemingly hopeless scenarios.

This class is not for experts or masters, including myself, and won’t produce any. This for students who know nothing about the relationship between writing and activism (spoiler: writing *is* activism) and want to learn more. It's for students who feel disillusioned by the state of [insert: the city, state, country, world, climate justice, the gutting of public health and education]. It's for aspiring or practicing writer-activists and change-makers who care about people and the craft of writing in creative and critical contexts. 

So that's the general context for our class. We'll come back to this in a minute. But now: Let's get setup! I’m going to walk you through the only important things on Classes, the course website, and our class server on Discord.

I'll primarily use Classes to collect your high-stakes writing assignments in dropboxes, under Assignments, and to share your scores, under Gradebook. The Discord invitation and syllabus links are posted under Content\Syllabus. 

Classes is irritating, unconducive to real learning since it encourages a grades-oriented mindset of "let me get my work done and GTFO with minimal interaction" and now it's also full of surveillance over your attendance and GenAI training on your work and feeding it to plagiarism checkers. To avoid that circus, I've created an external course website for us. 

The website home page has the course calendar, along with details like meeting time, modality, and how to schedule with me. The Calendar states the weekly "theme" and contains links to the weekly materials, like the readings, lecture notes (which will be posted at the end of each class), and writing due that week, and notes what we'll discuss, play, and write in each class. The readings are listed at the top of each week. Aim to read as much of them as possible before class on Tuesday, which is when any weekly responses are due. Many of these readings are short, so we can spend a lot of time focusing on how they're put together in addition to their content. And they're eclectic &mdash; I reached for things I thought you might not have encountered before.

Announcements: Any announcement I make on Discord will also be cross-posted here. You can find them on Discord by ctrl-F "Announcements" or check this page.

Syllabus: Course description, course-specific policies, and Pace policies. I'll point to a few course-specific policies (Required Materials, Tech/Platforms, Grading Breakdown, Accessibility, Attendance, Academic Integrity).

Alt-Grading: If you’re actively engaged in working through everything we do, I want to make sure that random circumstance doesn't interfere with your grades. (Overview, Checklist, Participation, Assignments, Deadlines, Redemption System). Participation emphasizes asking questions rather than answering them.

Discord: The Discord tutorial page has a breakdown of Discord's basic functions. If you've never used Discord, don't be intimidated! Discord's controls are a lot like text messaging or social media. You can get by with these 3 main functions: click #text channels on the left to enter them, type in the message box, and hit enter to send; click 🧵 and 📌 at the top of #text channels for a directory of threads (click a thread name to join and send messages in the panel that appears) and pinned posts; and click 🔊Voice channels on the left 1x to join voice-only and 2x to join voice-and-video.

In text channels, the chat bar is located in the main view, at the bottom-center of the screen. The message box is where you type your messages (which are visible to all members of the channel). In voice channels, the main view displays the users in the voice channel and the controls.

On the right, in the expanded Member List view, you can click on a user's name to read their profile (display name, username, pronouns, server roles, status, and About Me) or direct message (DM) them. 

To DM someone, click their username in the expanded Member List, or click the upper left Discord icon to open up your DM history. You can also have one-on-one calls this way.

FAQs: Frequently asked questions will be posted here, as they're asked and answered!

Playlist: And on the fun side of things, there's a playlist page curated by me and former students if music helps stir the words in you.

You can navigate to these pages using the links on the side. Each page also has internal links and a table of contents for accessibility purposes. The links at the top will take you to: my Zcal scheduling page, where you can see my available times during my Coffee Chat hours. 

Discord: The Discord tutorial page walks you through this in writing for any tasks you have to take care of by tonight. First, customize your profile. Upload a profile picture, and enter your display name &mdash; an alias, like mine, so that relative anonymity can help ease barriers to participating in writing &mdash; and your pronouns. If you don't choose a pseudonym by tonight, I'll choose one for you and will change your profile accordingly. You can use one of the placeholders for your About Me section if you like.
Once you've done that, click on the #get-roles channel and select the ones that describe you. Your selections will automatically be added to your profile.

Check the Discord tutorial to adjust your user preferences, like color themes, font size and spacing, etc. It also has a directory of channels and what we'll use them for. 

Now to circle back to our metaphoric opening: "The weather drapes a sleek, thermobaric flank on one side of today and a chilled muzzle on the other," and I'd like you to post, free-form and stream-of-consciousness and also in response to my rhetorical questions, in #classroom. 

Do you feel something from this metaphor? Where do you feel the identification of a feeling first, even as an inarticulate beginning? Where do you feel that identification become coherent? How do you even begin to figure something like that out?

This class is about learning how to figure something like that out, learning about the role that rhetoric &mdash; whose canons for effective communication include invention (coming up with something in prewriting), arrangement (organizing it in prewriting), style (making craft decisions during drafting), memory (recalling information, either for oral presentation or for revision purposes), and delivery (how the message is presented) &mdash; plays in creative writing for social justice.

Metaphors ask us to reflect on the relationships between things. So do the tiny white spaces between sentences, and the larger spaces between paragraphs. Form, also, asks us to reflect on relationships &mdash; specifically between design and "argument."

Understand also that an argument, contrary to what you might have been taught, doesn't just mean thesis or aggression or debate or persuasion but also the less definable ways that texts affect readers. Texts always argue. Effective texts understand that the form contributes to or performs the argument.
