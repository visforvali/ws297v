# 14.2 - *Dwelling* Room 2

**Instructions**: You were asked to do the worldbuilding and some initial writing in Week 13; instructions are [here](/notes/notes-12.2.md){:target="_blank"}. 

With the shadows and the space surveyed, I let my eyes close again, drifting back into sleep. Until &mdash; a sound starts echoing through the hallway and slips its way in through my open door.

It sounds like scratching? Each new scratch pulls at my eyelids more, begging them to open to go investigate the sound and its source to make it stop. I reluctantly sweep my legs out from the bed, feet meeting cold, wooden floorboards, and endeavour to find the source to see if a few bangs on a wall or ceiling would make it stop.

Leaving my room and standing in the hallway, I wait for the sound one more time, ears trained to each hum and buzzing tone in the deafening silence for the sound that will interrupt it soon. It comes once more, and it sounds like maybe a scratching from the attic. Perhaps some pests or nocturnal critters are making camp up there.

Surveying the ceiling, I spot the door to the attic. I don't want a face-to-
face encounter with whatever may be up there. I hope that the sound of the
attic latch opening will be enough to scare away my night time intruder Clambering up to grab the pull string to open the attic door, I give it a tug and am met with stubborn resistance. The sound of the door rattling against its hinges is louder than any scratching that could be contained in the attic.

Stuck, or perhaps locked? Whichever the case, I'm unable to open it. My investigation halted there. I make a mental note to myself to investigate it later, see if it’s simply stuck or somehow locked with a key I don't have. The attic's unknowns swirl in my imagination as to what could be up there, secrets that at some point will need my attention, but for now it remains unknown to me. For now it can wait. 

My thoughts trail behind me as I stumble back towards my bedroom until &mdash; louder than before. From my place in the hallway I can tell this time it definitely didn't come from the attic, but instead the guest room...

Walking into the guest room, I flip on the light switch, letting my eyes adjust to the brightness while still listening for the sound. I move around the bed and stand in the middle of the room, just listening before I take a moment to look at the room around me. I haven't spent much time moving the things in this room, my late Uncle's room. I'm going to keep the furniture with the intent to convert it into a guest bedroom, but unsure of what to do with the last remainder of his things.

Uneasy in this space so personal to someone else, I find myself tiptoeing
through the room. Moving through the room slowly, my stomach feels like it
could drop. Then &mdash; I hear a sound: a small, startled inhale.

Looking for the source of the sound, my mind conjures up the shape of what could've caused it, my eyes scanning the room until it appears before me. The shadow of something small, cowering, the shape of it slinking away from my sight. My eyes are drawn to where its shadow creeps out. I can't help but look. I try to make out the shape of the small thing pulling its body into a small bundle and almost out of sight.

I move towards the shadow, curious of its presence and the way it hides
in the corner of the room. My instinct is to reach out to it but I hesitate. A
small hand juts out from the shadows and grabs onto my wrist. The room
reels as it shifts. The furniture returns and the room fills with light and
pictures and an overwhelming sense that I am somewhere I shouldn't be.

I remember the first time I came in here as a child, curious and emboldened to explore a private space, tiptoeing and quietly opening drawers and cupboards hoping to find...What? What had I been hoping to find, what was it instead that I found? I find myself walking through this memory as I had tiptoed through this room as a child. 

[*15 min writing interlude: What is the ghost/memory haunting this room? Why this room and place? Why are they still here? Why do you feel compelled to record it in writing?*]

When the shadow lets go, I feel this memory fall away from me, like a loose page slipping out of a book. I glance down at my hand and see it marked, a spreading shape like a stifled giggle escaping. I look around the room, dazed. The shadow seems to fade into the rest of the soft darkness scattered throughout the room. Unsure of what I could've heard or what I thought I might've seen, I leave the
room and head back to bed, taking one last moment to pause and look over my Uncle's old bedroom. My stomach settles as I turn off the light and close the door.

Standing out in the dim hallway in between the doorways to the guest
room and my own, I pause to think of the small shadow in the room, the
memory that feels only like an echo now, and the small mark on my arm from
where it reached out and touched me. 

[*15 min writing interlude: How has this haunting "marked" you, i.e. how are you forever changed by remembering and recording this ghost?*]

It all feels like a strange dream that is now hidden away behind the closed guest room door. I'm not sure of what I'd find behind it if I were to open it once more.
